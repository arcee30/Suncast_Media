Hey, welcome back solar warriors. This is another episode of Suncast. On the eighth of August. I was invited out to Houston, Texas for the opening of the solar module factory by S E G solar. This manufacturing plant in the heart of oil country boasts a fully automated production line with an initial capacity of two gigawatts of panels per year, with plans to expand to five gigawatts by 2030, you see, while many are saying that they're bringing their manufacturing back to domestic soil, SCG solar is actually already manufacturing panels right here in America, I was so grateful to be asked to speak at the opening ceremony, and that's what I'm going to share with you here in this episode. And while we were there, we were lucky enough to be given a personalized tour of the factory. And believe it or not, in my almost 20 years in the industry, having worked for two solar manufacturers. This is my actual first panel manufacturing factory tour. If you go over to our YouTube channel@youtube.com, forward slash, at Suncast media, you can see that full factory tour of how seg is automating the production line for solar panels, as well as clips from the opening ceremony. You won't want to miss this firsthand look into the inside of a solar manufacturing plant. But without further ado, here's my speech from the opening ceremony of the SCG solar manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, another fascinating moment here on Suncast. Hope you enjoy it's not lost on anybody here that the one thing you don't get back today is the time you've invested to be here. You chose to be here instead of being with your customers, with your family, maybe surfing, that's what I'd be doing if I wasn't here, Jim, I've had the great privilege of watching this team mature in ways that many of us did not expect or anticipate. So I just want to say thank you to June. I remember, well, sitting in your presence in office. I remember, well, not just the skepticism that we'd ever have manufacturing back here, but that I'd get to in some way, in some small way, see, it happen, be involved. I remember, like Mark, the first time that Jim called me and said, We're gonna build a fact, don't tell anybody yet. We're gonna build a factory in Texas. I was like, You are crazy. I don't know what you're talking about. That's when that's nuts. But genuinely, as I stand here today, I'm filled with a sense of pride for this moment. It's a sense of pride more than anything, for the accomplishment of our industry. Knowing how long it has taken us to get here, we deserve this. Raise your hand if you've been in the solar industry for more than a year. All right, my solar warriors, that's what I'm talking about. We are on the front lines of the clean energy transition. Many of you know that I've had nearly a 20 year career in the solar industry. I've worked for a lot of solar companies, but very early on, I got a chance to join a major manufacturer, as Jim alluded to, that gave me my first glimpse into what it really looks like to build a world class product and a world class team. Now it was at that job that I had the good fortune to meet arguably the best solar salesman in the United States. I'm sure that holds true for many of you, because that's why you're here. I remember this gentle but sincere handshake, one that really genuinely didn't seem to match a six foot two thick square frame, and at that time in my career, you would have never convinced either of us that a decade later, we'd be seeing a revival of domestic solar manufacturing, let alone participating in making it happen. BP, solar, Evergreen, rec, Shuko shot shell sharp and a bunch of other companies that start with S are no longer here. They pulled up anchor and they set sail for Asia. And though I've gotten the promise throughout much of my career of the possibility of visiting these technological marvels in their native environment, that promise always seemed to be laced with some warnings about food and alcohol, customs that I'd need to prepare for, and the opportunity truly never really materialized. That is to say, I've never been to Asia or in one of these facilities. If you polled, I doubt that any of our team back in the day would have picked our gentle giant, Jim. Would as the solar module CEO on the vanguard of proving us all wrong about where these kinds of factories are supposed to exist. That was 2012 and while I've worked with more than a half a dozen global solar manufacturers, all of whom who have had their opportunity, I might say, This is my first time ever standing in a world class solar panel manufacturing facility, and I am super proud that it's S, E, G's opportunity. Thank you, Jim, for helping fulfill that dream for me. Thanks for the invitation to be here and proudly exhibiting the essence of our own home state motto of North Carolina, which is ese cuan videri, to be rather than to seem. While dozens of other manufacturers, many name brands that we all know and admire, have touted their forthcoming us, manufacturing facilities, a small band of brothers here, Jim, June, Jacob, some more folks that start with Jay, quietly and confidently, been at work getting their ducks in a row. Today, we're not just opening a factory here in Texas. We're standing on the foundation of the next generation of our solar industry. We call it the solar revolution. We'll come back to that word time and time again. We get to witness this modern marvel of machinery come to life. This factory represents, truly, the heart and soul of our nation's clean energy dream, a revolution that began right here on American soil, more than 70 years ago. See back in 1954 many of you already know that in Bell Labs, the first functional, practical photovoltaic cell was created, and since then, we've seen unbelievable advancements in technology and progress and deployment of that technology on land and on sea, even up in space. The final frontier was the first frontier for solar. Today, we're going to look around and see a fully modernized facility. You know, Mark and I were talking about how in his first factory visit, there were hand soldering cells. Many of you have probably made such factory tours today, you'll see nobody hand soldering. You'll see no such manual attachment to this product. It's a fully automized, modernized and automated facility, and Houston. Houston is known globally as the energy capital of the world, and for good reason, it's now in the forefront of the renewable energy renaissance. This great city, once the heartbeat of the oil and gas industry, is now leading the charge, as Jim rightly pointed in the transition to clean renewable energy, Houston is not a city to be left behind. Houston has always led the charge to provide reliable power, to power our dreams, the American dream, our future. It's fitting that this new chapter of solar manufacturing is unfolding right here in the heart of Texas. Today. We all get to witness history and help Jim, June, Jacob and this S, E, G family fulfill the great American dream. You see, entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart. Remember another great dreamer, Walt Disney, said, the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing in the past decade, the solar industry in the United States has grown at an unprecedented rate, one that we really truly only dreamed of when at two gigawatts, we were selling the largest solar manufacturing facility in the world. Back in 2011 2012 back in 2010 there were only 2000 megawatts of solar capacity installed across the country today, that number has skyrocketed to over 200,000 megawatts. This remarkable growth is a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone in this room and beyond this room, people dedicated to doing rather than talking about doing. But this factory is also more than just a symbol of growth and the maturity of our industry. It's a cornerstone of building a sustainable domestic energy policy by manufacturing solar panels right here in the United States, we are reducing our dependence on foreign imports. We're creating more than 500 high quality, high paying jobs, and we're reducing our dependence. We're ensuring that our renewable energy future is built with American ingenuity and resilience. These are qualities that are deeply seated on both sides of the aisle. Doesn't matter where you grew up, where you currently live, what your political or religious affiliation is.

Americans value hard work. It's. Self Reliance, and the truth is that that is the heartbeat of the solar industry. And let us not forget when we talk about policy, that the role of the inflation Reduction Act, a landmark piece of legislation, is bringing these jobs back to American soil, just as FDR New Deal helped revitalize our nation during challenging times, the IRA is now fueling a new era of economic growth and environmental stewardship like we've never seen before. This factory is but another example of the success of this policy, proving that with the right support, an American based manufacturing sector can and will survive, thrive and lead the world as we celebrate this milestone, and it is no insignificant milestone today to see this factory come online in the time that it has come online with the prescience of the people who helped bring this factory to life while others were about talking, let us remember that we're carrying a baton in this race, a race towards a sustainable future. That baton has been passed by those who, here in Houston and beyond, have helped power this nation for more than a century. America knows what it looks like to generate electricity and have that electricity fuel dreams coming into reality. We're the torch bearers of progress, illuminating that path for generations to come. This is the solar energy generation. This commitment to reshore our renewable energy manufacturing is no longer a dream of a bygone era, thanks to the courage and entrepreneurial leadership of June Jim and many others here at the SCG team, we are here to stand witness. Dedication and hard work have made this moment possible. Together, we are igniting a movement. It's a movement that will power our homes, our businesses, our careers and our future with clean, sustainable, homegrown power right here in the heart of Texas, in summary essay Kwame videri to be, rather than to seem, or to put it more succinctly, in the words of Snoop Dogg, don't talk about it. Be about it. Hey, thanks for sticking around all the way to the end. Solar warrior, I want to thank you again for being here, but also I want to thank SCG solar for having us there. They invited us out to their opening ceremony and allowed me to say a few words. I hope that those words were meaningful to you, as I know they were meaningful for our friends over SCG, solar in particular, June and Jim, thank you so much for all the opportunity that you've given don't forget to head over to our YouTube channel.
