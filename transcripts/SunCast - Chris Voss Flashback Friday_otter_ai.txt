Speaker 1  0:00  
We could engage in an intellectual exercise where I could prove to you that there's always more on the table, you could see I don't care if your handle from as garden sees everything, there's always more on the table. And I want to I want to tease that out early on. Hey,

Nico Johnson  0:15  
if you're unfamiliar, we call this Flashback Friday. And it's my way of giving you a glimpse back at something we did recently that I think you should have listened to, whether it's content from one of our many live events, or perhaps a replay of older archived episodes that have garnered 1000s of downloads, or maybe just a glimpse at what was published on the podcast this last week. This is yet one more way that you can learn and grow with us here on SunCast. Remember, you can always find the resources and learn more about today's guests recommendations, etc. On the blog at my suncast.com to get ready to tune up your skills solar warrior as we tune in to another powerful conversation here on SunCast. Well, solar warriors, you may recall that back in episode 83, I featured one of my all time favorite books, that book is titled never split the difference negotiating as if your life depended on it. And to my surprise, it garnered loads of feedback, including a retweet by the author, Chris Voss, so I reached out to him to thank him and also invited him to come on SunCast. And to my surprise, he accepted since so many of you are involved in some aspect of sales, and in particular, executive leadership, founding your companies. I'm really excited today to further unpack the details of Chris's book with the man himself. We'll try to extrapolate as best we can to how it's relevant to the solar industry. But know that this is wisdom you can apply in your everyday life from buying a car to navigating that next argument with your husband. Hey, Chris, welcome to SunCast

Speaker 1  2:00  
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be on with you.

Nico Johnson  2:03  
It is our pleasure to have you on. So Chris, let's get to the underlying philosophy that led to the way that you've crafted your follow on you know, your your business. Now you're consulting, you spent a quarter century practically at the FBI negotiating with terrorists, most often with kidnap victims and negotiating with terrorists who had done kidnappings internationally. Could we talk about the first time that you realized that terrorist negotiation or kidnap negotiation directly applies to business? Yeah, well,

Speaker 1  2:38  
you know, I started to suspect that really early on, when I finally went to the training, specifically to work, kidnapping negotiation, at the time, it was a critical incident negotiation team, or the CIT team, if you will, everybody you know, but in the government loves their acronyms. The guy that was doing the instruction actually was a buddy of mine. He and I had been trained originally as negotiators together. And I grew up in an entrepreneurial environment, my father had his own business. So I always like to think of things in those terms. And this guy that was teaching us because I thought I was gonna get the secret handshake, or what are the magic words, you know, hocus pocus? would, you know, what's the mystery? And he said, You know, every country you go into or kidnappings, you said, you need to find out in advance, they're going to have an opening ask, you know, a ransom they're going to ask for. And there's always going to be predictable percentage of that asks that they're gonna look for. And then he said, and there's always going to be a duration of the expected amount of time that kidnappings gonna take. I remember saying to myself, we're talking about a commodities market, I mean, they're gonna, they're gonna have their pricing, and they're gonna have their turnover on the commodity. I remember initially being horrified by it. But I said, this is a market price. And this is an expected turnover of a commodity. And that was when especially in the kidnapping, I began to realize that it was dealing with hard nosed international kidnapping to separate away from other kinds, right. But it was definitely it's a commodities exchange. It's a hard nosed business. And the more I learned about it, I mean, they are in business, it's a business model. They got a division of labor, and they look at it as a business. So yeah, it was when I first got trying to start working kidnap

Nico Johnson  4:17  
one thing that sticks out for me as well. That's a key differentiation perhaps between terrorists negotiation, in particular with kidnapping and business is the notion of the sole buyer. Could you unpack the whole idea of how a sole buyer benefits a kidnapper? Or in the kidnap negotiation and how that might slightly be different in the business world? And maybe there's some similarities. Yeah,

Speaker 1  4:37  
and you're always looking for the parallels? Yeah, we used to always challenge people who's who's got the leverage and kidnapping the kidnapper or the kidnap victims family. And you know, our instinctive reactions will kidnappers got all the leverage and, and I will say, wait a minute, I thought cash was K. I thought the person that had the money has the leverage, especially even even if If it's not a buyers market even if it's a seller's market cash is king. Well, I think kidnap victim family is a family the one with the cash and you know and who else are they going to sell the victim to you know, you got you got a buyers market you got you got one buyer if you're if you're a seller, you're at a disadvantage. And what people don't realize in the business world, which we've really discovered, since we've been out here, the procurement negotiator, the contracts negotiate. The supply chain negotiator is the exact profile of the International kidnap, I mean, just down to a tee. They react and think the same way. They're threatening or intimidating. They think they've got all the leverage, and you think they do too. And salespeople across the board and business people across the board are scared to death of the procurement people. I mean, I've had CEOs freak out over procurement. Well, the crazy thing is that everybody forgets. If procurement is talking to you, they just become the sole buyer. Nobody in any company ever puts their procurement people in the mix unless they want you supply chain contracts procurement, they have made the commitment to you, because their procurement is not wasting their time on deals are not going to make they have us and expected timeframe just like kidnappers to the procurement negotiators get somebody behind the table on his side, tapping his toes with his arms crossed he or she going like when are you going to get this product, you only got so much time to deliver this product, you can beat them up. But we need this product. So the crazy thing is, especially since the book came out, we're giving people so much more advice. Instead of being horrified when procurement gets involved. You shouldn't be ecstatic because that means if you don't lose your nerve, you got the deal. I

Nico Johnson  6:53  
just got goosebumps because I can think of many examples right now that I'm negotiating where it feels like the clouds just parted. I've suspected that because I'm in discussions directly with procurement, that it ought to be a good thing. I feel like a lot of us tend to diminish like, Oh, we're in and I'm referring to the solar industry, particularly, we're in a small subset of the energy market, right? We're still a little industry where perhaps people will waste time more. But the reality is, we're getting a lot of professional buyers on the counterparty side, in particular, when you're dealing as I am with folks at utilities who have been in this for a long time, or folks at large scale, you know, multimillion dollar contracts with large project developers, that's very encouraging. And I certainly want to unpack, there's a lot that you touched on there. As we get through this, I want to return back to the idea that procurement is exactly as a prototype of the kidnapper will for sure drill into the notion of defusing angry tones and things like that. One of the things that came to mind as you were going through the ideas will just setting the stage for negotiation. You mentioned the process of slowing down and negotiation how that actually gives you more options as the counterparty? How would you turn this around and reference the idea of slowing down and a delay that saves time is another reference from the book? Right?

Speaker 1  8:12  
Yeah, you know, a more deliberate process saves time for you know, for a couple reasons. Number one, you got to tease out what could potentially be on the table. I mean, we could engage in an intellectual exercise where I could prove to you that there's always more on the table that you could see, I don't care if your handle from Asgard and sees everything. You know, there's always more on the table. And I want to I want to tease that out early on. We can accelerate the process afterwards, once we get a good feel for what's on the table. Yeah, you

Nico Johnson  8:44  
said that the point of negotiation is to find out how much money is on the table. That's actually the whole point are sitting around the table figuring out how much money is on the table. So as your pre qualifying them, what are some questions you might ask to discern how much money is on the table pre qualify? What are the things that we're actually negotiating for?

Speaker 1  9:02  
We don't answer a lot of questions, we start getting people talking to us right away, like early on in the conversation, it will save them sounds like sounds on your mind. I mean, the other side's got tons of stuff they want to tell you they just want to know whether or not first whether or not you're going to listen. They actually care a lot less about whether or not they can trust you with the information I do about whether or not you're actually going to pay attention because if you're going to pay attention, chances are they can probably trust you. But the first big issue is are you going to pay attention to anything they say are you utterly wasting our time. Like if you had a conversation with somebody, they got something on their mind. I saw an article written by the Facebook's Head of Marketing probably about two and a half three years ago, said he was sick of being asked what's keeping you up at night? And then having nobody listened to his answer. I mean, just sick. So much so that he automatically expected anybody to ask him the open ended question that everybody loves to ask Mr. CEO What keeps you up at night? What's the biggest challenge you face? What's the biggest problem you're trying to solve? You know, but he knows ask great questions. And I'm shocked at the number of people that don't actually listen to the answer. So that's one of the reasons why we usually don't ask, we don't pull information by asking questions, we pull information with the use of labels, because I'm gonna get a much more unguarded stream of consciousness as a result of a label that I'm gonna get from a course,

Nico Johnson  10:25  
I want to understand labeling, because I feel like it's one of those that you do a great job in the book of explaining it, and I still come away not knowing how to directly apply it in each scenario. Would you just explain labeling and then I have a follow up on one specific scenario? Sure.

Speaker 1  10:38  
Labeling and it's also you got to make sure you get it right. The simplicity of the structure most people miss and I will say, it sounds like there's something on your mind. That's a label, I have intentionally avoided the use of the word ah, what an awful lot of people in accounting profession want to say, oh, yeah, I know that. I know that from counseling, I see. What I'm hearing is the use of the word eyes a pattern interrupt, it's a self centering distractor. That doesn't mean it's wrong. It just means is out of context. In this instance, like the usual word is appropriate when I want to say, Look, I'm sorry, I can't do I use the word AI twice? To say no, I use it first to say I'm sorry. Because the incidentally, your brain reacts faster than my words, you've automatically in the instant that my brain reacts faster than my words, you've automatically initially he said to yourself, what's he sorry about, you put up a little bit of a defense, I've warned you that there may be some bad news coming, which also gets to the point of is, I'm sorry, a bad phrase? No, it's not a bad phrase, it depends on when you use it, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to want to use it as a warning. And then boom, I'm gonna hit you with the bed. And

Nico Johnson  11:50  
I have a tactical example, I have a client who just yesterday sent me a reframing of the pricing structure, and he gave us a significant haircut, almost $200,000. So knowing that we're not going to take the haircut, and that he also has to do the deal with us. I should in a phone call, say, I'm sorry, and then follow that with that just doesn't work for him. Uh huh. With the late night DJ voice? Yeah, if you're gonna, if you're gonna talk to him, I'm going to talk to him because before I sent him the email, I wanted to have the courtesy of say, of him not seeing the email as in first response.

Speaker 1  12:22  
There's a number of reasons for saying it just like that. All great negotiators come to at least one way of gently saying no, we've seen this across the plan. We teach four ways to say no, the reason for that is, you know, my Harvard brothers and sisters are going to want you to say, well, let's go to outside criteria. And let's agree on an outside criteria that we both can agree on. And then we'll be bound by that outside criteria. Now that intellectually sounds wonderful. The first problem is you never got to agree on the outside criteria. Second problem is, what if the outside criteria is good, but it hurts you, you still can't do it. Let's say there's a fair price, but you still can't do that deal at that fair price, are you supposed to do that deal. So that just doesn't work? For me that just doesn't work for us immediately gets you away from the outside criteria problem. You do not want to be trapped by outside criteria, your procurement guy is going to try and trap you with outside criteria. Just as a word for us. He's not going to come back and say, somebody snagging a message. You know, the procurement guy is not going to come back to you and say, Oh, yes, it does. But we know what he's probably going to try to lure you into. He's going to say, you know, we want a detailed breakdown of all your costs, or your costs and expenses. You know what our answer is, I'm not doing that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this has worked for us. That's one of the procurement guys great ways to just hammer the heck out of us procurement guy, supply chain guy that's in the interest of a great relationship. And in the interest of a long term deal, please give us a detailed breakdown of your costs.

Nico Johnson  14:07  
So labeling our subtle questions that allow you to control the conversation in a way that puts it back into your counterparties. Court to address a concern. Yeah,

Speaker 1  14:17  
and let's let's draw a distinction between control and upper hand. Because we want to try and control we try to maintain an upper hand. And in many cases, we maintain the upper hand just because, you know, we refuse to be put in a position where we feel like we have to say yes, that's completely psychological. If you can't make me say, yes. And in reality, we can't. I mean, come on, we live in a first world. We're going to survive not getting this deal. We're going to think it's going to be the end of the world. But, you know, not that many of us get up in the morning with the legitimate concern whether or not we're going to die that day. And you know, you think you got problems, you know, go visit my friends in Baghdad, where they're actually worried about whether or not they're going to see the sunset. So you know, what are referral problems. You can't make it say yes. Now we you know, we don't. We don't hide information from other people because you can't make it say yes. But this open kimono process is a time suck. And time is money. You want me to give you all the open kimono? How am I going to show you the open kimono, that's going to take a massive amount of my time. And my time could be spent doing other deeds? Yeah. So you now driving my costs in an insane way. And if you want to drive my costs in an insane way, I'm going to share I want you for a partner anyway. Because the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Do I want to be married to you for years, while you do nothing but slaughter my profit margins? I don't know that I don't
