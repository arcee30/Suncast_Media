The way that we like to explain community solar to subscribers is that they don't actually buy this power, they buy a group on. So yeah, hey $90 and get $100 worth of value on their utility bill, it's not always going to be 90 and 100. But it's always going to be X percent discount on whatever we can generate on their behalf. So maybe one month that will be $100 of value that they'll have to pay 90 for keeping $10 as a discount. The next month, we had more sunlight because it's a better month from a weather perspective. And they got $200 and they saved get 10% discount. Now it's 20 bucks. Community

Nico Johnson  0:38  
Solar has been coined the fourth vertical in the solar revolution. I am here with one of those entrepreneurs who is leading a company focused exclusively on community solar and how to grow it. Mostly how do we find those ever important subscribers, those customers who are buying the power from community solar products. My name is Nico Johnson, I'm your host here at the SunCast Media Zone live at Midwest solar Expo Media Zone is brought to you by solar simplified, I'm joined by Aviv Shaggy, the CEO of solar simplified, thank you for partnering with us on the stage, as well as joining us here to talk about how the community solar sector is evolving. Good to see you. Of course,

Unknown Speaker  1:20  
thank you for having me.

Nico Johnson  1:20  
So I mentioned that there are different players in the market is in this process of maturing for community solar. One of the roles that I feel like is less understood maybe the least understood is the role of the aggregator. It's a term that I hadn't heard until maybe about a year ago, help us understand what is an aggregator with regards to community solar.

Speaker 1  1:41  
I mean, you can think of all of the aggregators is a nice name that encompasses everything related to subscribers, aggregates, projects, community solar projects, on the one side, we aggregate subscribers on the other side, we try to mix and match the two, yeah, to make sure that everything is working correctly for everybody's benefit. Yeah. And so, you know, we come in, usually, after the developers already found the land, got the permits, figured out, they're going to build a project and before the project, the actual getting built, partner up with developers to figure out who are the right subscribers, residential, mass market, low income, small commercial mom and pop shops, large commercial, whatever it is, depending on the regulatory environment where that actual product is going to get built in, and then actually execute on that plan. Promoting the project to subscribers, getting them to sign up, making sure that symbol for the subscribers to sign up. That's why we chose the name solar simplified, have them go through that process, match them to the right project, and at the end, making sure that the actual savings show up on their bill on a monthly basis.

Nico Johnson  2:52  
So your job is to go out and find customers. For the developers who are building the solar projects, all the electrons coming from the solar projects need people to buy those electrons. Do these subscribers really understand what they're signing up for?

Speaker 1  3:05  
I would hope so. Like that's my goal, obviously, I mean, different people that will have different levels of interest, how deep do they want to go and understanding what's happening here. But in most markets, the way that we like to explain community solar to subscribers, which is legally correct, as well, is that they don't actually buy this power. They buy a group on, so yeah, hey $90 and get $100 worth of value on their utility bill. Now, it's not always going to be 90 and 100. But it's always going to be X percent discount on whatever we can generate on their behalf. So maybe one month that will be $100 value that they'll have to pay 90 for keeping $10 as a discount. Yeah. The next month, we had more sunlight, because it's a better month from a weather perspective. And to God $200 And they saved get 10% discount. Now it's 20 bucks. Yeah. And they had to pay 180 is

Nico Johnson  4:04  
always benchmarked at a certain percent discount. Is that the guarantee? Yes. So the guarantee

Speaker 1  4:08  
and community solar across the entire countries? 99% of the time, I want to say is a fixed discount persona percentage level? No dollars, okay. And then the fluctuations just depend on the weather. Do you

Nico Johnson  4:24  
as an aggregator have to go interface with the utilities? Is it your job to make sure the utilities understand the billing protocol? And yep, manage all of the how the kilowatt hours are exchanged. That must be quite complex. How do you manage that?

Speaker 1  4:37  
Yeah, I mean, so we're a tech company. Everything's automated. Yeah. We have algorithms that we built in house that help us to manage that flow, so that people can maximize their savings as quickly as possible, but obviously keeping everything within the regulatory compliance of the specific state. And we have to do this exercise actually twice with utilities. So we have to do it upfront. count on how much people are going to be are going to be getting in the future. And then once that energy has been produced and was allocated to people's bills, getting all of that information back true up exactly. Up and able to inform the subscribers, hey, go check your bill, you should have gotten $23 in savings last month. Okay, go double check your bill and see that it's actually there. 99% of the time, it's there. Yeah. But we want to make sure we're communicating with our subscribers, our subscribers,

Nico Johnson  5:28  
opting into these community solar projects, expecting a discount off of all of their electricity. So I used to pay $100 of all my electricity. Now it's 90, and it's clean energy. I mean, that seems like a no brainer option. Yep.

Speaker 1  5:43  
So I assumed that's what they expect. That's what at least those are subscribers communicate with us? Is their expectation better is also our goal. Yeah, obviously, we don't control the weather. So we can't promise anything but the way that our algorithms work, in that they are trying to maximize your savings up to the full amount of your bill. But yes, there it's a lot of back and forth from making sure that people understand what they're signing up for. Remember what they signed up for after a couple of months, because some of the utilities are slow. Yeah, it's take a while. So yeah, it's a lot of communication back and forth. And a bunch of really smart tech people and algorithm people behind the scenes to make sure it's actually working. Well,

Nico Johnson  6:23  
I think what's fascinating is that most consumers probably would not assume that by opting into clean energy, solar energy, right, they're gonna pay less. And what it says is two, part one, we are still doing a relatively poor job of educating those consumers correct that, too, we have a power plant that now is below the generation cost of traditional fossil fuels. And that's the only way we can offer it is that we're actually producing power at less than the alternative cost, which is, we used to be the alternative, but now also fuels, the alternative costs, and it's higher, which is why we can guarantee this product. I feel like that should engender a sense of trust and relationship between you the aggregator and the consumer, I know that we will talk a minute about how developer relationship works. But I feel like there are times where I see or I feel like I sense that aggregator is working on behalf of developers. Can you contrast that in terms of the trust relationship that the consumer should have for you as the aggregator right. So unfortunately,

Speaker 1  7:25  
I think people have heard in this country a lot about green energy, and solar, and hydro and wind, and all sorts of stuff from so many different angles, that they get confused. And so that trust in many places around the country has actually been broken, or you need to repair it, and try to rebuild that trust. Because unlike any other product that's out there right now in the country, this is a guaranteed savings product, right? It's highly regulated by state governments, by the federal government, by so many different agencies that we literally cannot charge you more. Yeah, we have to give you that discount, and the utilities make sure that that discount is applied to your bill. Yeah. And so there should be trust, I think there wasn't because of a lot of confusion to your earlier point. As an industry, we have not done the best job at educating subscribers and educating the market on what we're offering. So that is a part of our job, when we're going to talk to subscribers. No, because we want our subscribers to be there. For as long as possible. They want to acquire subscribers all the time and mix and match. And so for us to be able to do that we have to rebuild that trust with whoever it is that we're approaching to in order to get them to sign up, basically.

Nico Johnson  8:53  
So let's turn from consumers to developers, because the folks that actually get these projects built to the developers, you partner with necessarily you partner with developers, because they're generating those electrons. And they're relying on you the aggregator in many ways, what folks may or may not understand is the developers need to choose there are a dozen, maybe two dozen different folks they could partner with to help them essentially retail, that electricity to consumers. Right yet. The residential sector is very mature, the utility sector is very mature. I sense still in the community solar sector that we have a bit of growing left to do, what will it look like when we do reach a level of maturity? That's, that that starts to reflect more of how the industry has already achieved that success. And that that maturity versus the relative immaturity we see right now in the community solar market. Yeah,

Speaker 1  9:42  
I mean, we can you can slice and dice that questions, five different ways. But, I mean, I think on the subscriber side, we have not watched the product market fit that you would think like residential solar folks have wished him sure when a residential solar company approaches something to put solar panels on their roof, you kind of understand what they're doing. You don't know exactly the ins and outs, but you understand what they're explaining, right? This niche in the industry under community solar is just so new people just don't know that this exists. Yeah. And so we have to go to the education, we have to go through the explanations and make sure everybody understands. And then we also have that on the developer side. It's a lot of developers that don't know what's out there. Yeah. They don't know any aggregators, so maybe the no one aggregator because their buddy works there. Yeah. And they just don't know how the industry works. And they know, they don't know what terms they should agree to what prices are out there. How risk sharing works, how things could be better or worse for their business. And now we're talking about developers, but there's usually an asset owner that buys it from the developer, there's a bank that loans of additional money, like a mortgage, yeah, to the asset. There's tax equity, there's so many different types of financial players behind the developer, that we also as an industry have to kind of mature and get to a level where everything is kind of standardized. Yeah. And everybody's, I wouldn't say everything is the same, but everybody are playing in the same level. That needs to be a much higher level, I think, than what where we are right now, you

Nico Johnson  11:20  
mentioned standardization, I get the sense that there are a number of folks in the value chain who seem to be accepting the status quo, right, rather than looking at the other sectors and saying, Well, why aren't we doing it that way? Could you talk about the various players and how that acceptance of the status quo is creating? is perpetuating this immaturity? Yeah,

Speaker 1  11:42  
I mean, I obviously don't want to mention any names. And I love most of the people in our industry, everybody's great. And we're really trying to continue to build the industry as a whole. You know, a developer told me this a couple of weeks ago, one that we are not working with. He was basically saying, I prefer the devil. I know to the devil, I don't. And I he's just like, I know that I'm kind of getting screwed. Uh huh. But I don't have the time or the mental capacity to focus on figuring out what's better. Get used to it. Yeah. And it's okay. It kind of, I'm sorry to say it's, it sounds really bad to me as an outsider. I'm not a solar person. Yeah, not my back. And I'm a software guy. It sounds really bad to me looking from the outside in. When people are saying, I know I'm getting screwed. And I'm okay with it. Like, no, you should not be Yeah, like it is. It's literally your business. It's your livelihood. Yeah, you should care more about understanding what's out there. What the different approaches who are different players, who offers what so you can maximize your shareholders, you know, interests and your employees interests of your stakeholders and your company.

Nico Johnson  13:00  
Is the way that tax equity and debt are handled and community solar structurally different from other types of solar projects. And, and if not, how, how do you see this dynamic playing out in community solar in a different way? Because it does to me feel like it's the role playing is different, even though it's a similar assets? Right?

Speaker 1  13:19  
I don't know if it's different. Most folks tend to have all three. Yeah, so an equity sponsor that owns the project, a tax equity that helps to get the tax incentives and a lender or a bank. I know different ones have sometimes, you know, two of the three, you usually don't see just one, right? You know, it's usually never just a sponsor sponsor with a bank or sponsor with a tax or all three combined. I think there's definitely a kind of a misalignment of incentives between those three, because obviously, the bank wants the most stable thing possible. They do not want to take any risks. Tax Equity, wants to rip the rewards off as quickly as possible. And just make sure nothing gets screwed. On the flip side, though, sponsor equity, the actual asset owners, the IDPs that buy these projects, they want to maximize their value. Those don't always align with let's say, the safest approach the bank would take. Yeah, there's a little bit of, you know, conflicting interests, I would say, between different types of players. Yeah, we're growing as an industry. Well, again, we need to get to some standardization. And even if you talk to lenders and banks right now, there is no standardization if you on how you get a loan for a project like this. Although if you look at utility scale, they'll discuss kind of standard it bank, but they've had, what 20 3040 years extra to figure these things out. We're kind of all learning very, very fast as we go.

Nico Johnson  14:50  
There seems to be as we've seen, this sort of highlighted a lack of sophistication, and I feel like it is in particular around it. The various risk sharing mechanisms. And we have great examples from real estate and other areas where risk is mitigated in different ways and their different risk sharing mechanisms to offset the lopsided imbalance that we see sometimes in particularly community solar who talked to that point? Yeah.

Speaker 1  15:16  
So I would say there's like two sides, maybe to that question, let's maybe talk about the risk sharing in terms of, you know, what we do with developers, for example, how we share our risk. If we're sitting right now, in the lovely Hyatt hotel here in Rosemont, outside of Chicago, hotels in general, are not the name that you know, on the door, there's a building owner, there's the name on the door, the brand, Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, etc. As the actual operator of this facility, right. And they figured out over the past 100 200 years, how to share the risks. And so if the operator does something they're not supposed to be doing, or they're not keeping the performance as high as they're expected, they're gonna have to compensate the building owner and the brand goes the same way with the brand doing the same, like causing an issue or something like that, where the operator can't do their job. Well, same goes for the building owner, if the maintenance of the building is not up to standard, it's going to hurt everybody else's revenue. Yeah, we have to compensate each other. That doesn't really exist in community solar, right. Yeah. When what we've taken on ourselves at solar simplified, with our developers, and our IPP partners, is to make sure that every agreement they signed with us where we are the aggregator, we take our risks on ourself, right. So if we subscribe, the wrong subscriber, and they've cancelled very fast, doesn't cost anything to replace them. And we will do it in house, it doesn't even get communicated to them unless they're interested, obviously. Because if we messed up something, we want to make sure we make them whole as fast as possible. Same goes for collections, let's say it's a utility that's not paying not funneling the money on time. We are the face of that project with the subscribers of the utility with the local government that cetera weren't going to be the ones to go and fight with the utility to get the payment. Basically, shielding the developer and the acid and especially the bank, which we talked about doesn't want to deal with non collections issues, right? We'll be there to offset that payment, make them whole, and go and fight with whoever we need to fight with to collect the money for that project.

Nico Johnson  17:31  
I guess it might be helpful to hear how other other ways that it's done, because what I hear you saying seems completely reasonable. And it also makes me think, like, well, the way that it's being done, somebody is getting screwed. Yeah.

Speaker 1  17:46  
So unfortunately, the way because it's a very new industry. I mean, we're less than 10 years old, yeah. And actual projects being operated until like, eight, nine years, or like, right, longest tenured projects out there. So the way it's been going on right now, is that developers and IPPs basically carry all of that risk. Uh, huh. Most of my competitors, unfortunately, are kind of an outsourcing GM. You want customer acquisition that cost some money, you want management that's cost some extra, you want to billing that costs extra. Oh, and they don't do collections. Like if customers pay great. Customers don't pay or if utilities on time. Mr. Acid owner, Mr. Developer, that's your side of the of the problem. That's not our side, just outsourcing. I think there's there's a pretty big imbalance in the risk where the developers actually end up paying for services. But if, let's say data aggregators subscribed, the wrong subscribers doesn't understand what they signed up for. They're very quickly going to cancel, or they're definitely not going to pay for what they told the energy, those savings that they've put out that they've signed up for. And the power of that is, that's money that's not getting paid, or that very high churn is going to cause more problems for the developers developer gets to carry all of those risks and has to pay to acquire a new subscriber to have to take the bad debt, the losses in collections, because most of us don't actually send collections people to go to people's house and get the money back.

Nico Johnson  19:23  
It almost sounds like the way lead generation has been done. Right. But you pay for the lead whether they buy or not is not my problem. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. How interesting. Well, it's wonderful to know that as the industry matures, folks, like solar simplified are standing in the gap and saying, you know, what, we see an imbalance here and the risk being shared. We're going to take some of that off. Thank you for eliminating us as well on this role of the aggregator plays, I do think that not only is it a crucial role, because it is the energy retailer, but it's an often misunderstood role, and I feel like the aggregator is the one that while they do hold an Probably an outsized amount of power in the in the power imbalance. It's an underappreciated part of the of the necessary process, because community solar does have this interesting dynamic, like you said with this hotel that you need someone to bring folks to stay in the hotel for. Right? And that's not gonna be the building owner, right? And it's not going to be CBRE, right? jlm. Like, those companies are not interested in occupancy rates, right? They're interested in optimization of, in this case, the asset or solar farm, it's optimization of the electrons and making sure that at the connection point is delivering every electron that was promised. So a company like solar simplified is able to step in the gap and say, We will bring the customers we will fill, make sure you got an accessible and acceptable occupancy rate. What is the typical, let's continue this term occupancy rate? Was it typical in a fulfillment rate that's acceptable for a project?

Speaker 1  20:55  
I mean, in my book, 100% 100% Yeah, I'd say like 99.9 The one thing like the number one reason we see cancellations, yeah. Which I believe should be the number one reason across the entire industry is death. We don't know how to solve it. Yeah. And I mean, maybe that's a different startup at somebody else could could decide and figure it out. So Brian

Nico Johnson  21:16  
Johnson from Braintree is figuring that out, him

Speaker 1  21:19  
or Elon, or Bezos or somebody. My goal is to keep everything at 100%. Because we're at the end of the end backfill when they fall out. Exactly, yeah. At the end of the day, we're giving away money, the people as savings, yes, this should not be hard. The whole reason why it is hard, is because of the lack of trust we talked about. And because people don't understand what they're signing up generally, or stand, or the or maybe they do understand, but there's no trust with the aggregators, to make sure that we're at 100% at all times. Yeah. But that's my goal. We've been up and running, I want to say for four years, never have gone down below, like 99.9%. Wow. And so, you know, because our subscribers actually understand what they're signing up for. Yeah, we take the time to make sure they understand. And so that's how we're able to keep those numbers. And if those numbers drop to your point about occupancy, the occupancy drops, that's less revenue for the developer, meaning not as much money to be able to afford to build more solar right, and expand around the country and get more renewables deployed and more savings deployed to people. So we have to make sure that they're making money. If they'll make money. We'll have a lot more community solar throughout the country. Fantastic.

Nico Johnson  22:33  
And that's what this partnership is all about. And that is solar simplified. I'm glad that we had a chance to dig deeper into how community solar works in the role of the aggregator of Eve Shaggy is the CEO and founder of solar simplified. I'm Nico Johnson, your host here at the SunCast Media Zone live at Midwest solar Expo, presented by solar simplified. Thank you for joining us today, Aviv.
