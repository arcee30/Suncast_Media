Well, well, it's that time again. Solar warriors, everybody's favorite, biggest conference in North America that, of course, is re plus. Are you still calling it solar power International? Just about everybody I know has made the switch to re plus. Last year, we made enough jokes of SPI I mean re plus. But here it is, the episode to help you know what you need to know before you go re plus 2024. Is right around the corner, and every year, we partner with re plus to give the unofficial official before you go. Episode in audio format if you are watching us on YouTube, thank you for tuning in. There are a few things here that are a few things here that are visual in nature that might be helpful for you if you're listening on the podcast. Really appreciate you as well. You may want to click over and watch some of the things that Tim Morris and I, for example, talk about in terms of the show floor and orienting yourself to the massive map of this year's campus expanded to accommodate what we expect to be close to 50,000 attendees. That's right, 50,000 of your and my closest friends will be convening September 9 through 12th in Anaheim, California for the annual solar conference here in North America that's actually bigger than solar. That's why it's called R E. Plus, this episode is geared to help you orient yourself, not just to the show floor, but to your schedule, figure out how to best invest your time and energy, not waste any of those and get the most out of your trip to Anaheim, California in a few weeks time. But for now, let's get ready to tune up your skills. Solo warrior, as we tune into this year's no before you go R, E plus edition 2024 here we go. Well, many of you are anxious to know, how do I navigate my way around this massive show? As always, we have Tim Morris and the RE plus events team to help us guide the pathway for you. Tim Morris is the director of marketing for re plus events. Great to see you. Tim,

Unknown Speaker  2:17  
yeah, great to see you as well. Nico, thanks for having me.

Nico Johnson  2:19  
It's wonderful to have you. As as the weeks get closer, I imagine your calendar is overrunning, so thanks for taking time out of your schedule to help orient our solar warriors and give them a better sense of comfort that they know what they are getting into

Unknown Speaker  2:36  
any time to that end,

Nico Johnson  2:38  
you know, last year was a landmark, a banner year for the show. What was the attendance? Officially in Vegas, 40,000

Unknown Speaker  2:47  
last year in Vegas.

Nico Johnson  2:48  
Goodness, are we fingers crossed expecting? We'll cross over 50 1000s here in

Speaker 1  2:55  
Anaheim. We'll see. I think we're looking great, as is looking to surpass last year, so we'll see how it all shakes out at the end. But we're in a good bring it. We're in a good place. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  3:06  
well, having attended re plus since 2006 i It's baffling for me that we've achieved the scale and reach that we have. And each year, the campus seems to expand, and each year there are things that are new and noteworthy. So let's dive into the new and noteworthy for 2024 re plus in Anaheim, 10.

Speaker 1  3:26  
Yeah, absolutely. And as you mentioned, the campus does expand each and every year, and this year is no different. While we're heading back to Anaheim this year in California, we are going to be using a lot more property for our show this year, it's the Anaheim Convention Center and campus, and that includes several buildings, as I just mentioned, the Anaheim Convention Center itself, as well as the North towers within that, and the arena Plaza, but on top of and as well as level three, but on top of that, there's also the Marriott, the Marriott outdoor pavilion, the Sheraton and the Hilton are all part of this campus, in addition to the grand plaza in front of the convention center as well. So there's lots of places. There's no main place. There's lots of places that to find exhibitions, sessions, networking events. It's all over. It's all over the campus. It's going to be great. And people really need to think ahead this year about how they want to approach this, because it is a lot, and there's a lot of places they can go, and they're not going to be able to send it to see everything in all one go. So you know, best bring a team as well to help you experience all of what re plus has to offer.

Nico Johnson  4:33  
Yeah, well, said, you know, in years past, and I'm showing the screen here for anyone who's been to the RE plus.com re plus.com you can easily find a lot of this stuff. If you go to the general information, you'll find a lot of information here about where to go and what to know on the venue site, it does a great job of breaking out how the floors are oriented. I'll actually start using this and. As well as I'm showing you where the power up life stage is, but you can see that the campus has really spread out in years past. We kind of only stuck to halls ABC and a little bit of D. Obviously, the Marriott and Hilton are involved in a lot of stuff out in the Grand Plaza, but we are really stretching out all the way past the arena into, as I understand, even some venues outside the arena Plaza. So got a plan ahead. Tim, the the scale of the venue is is incredible, and getting oriented to it is a task that I tell people like least spend 1520 minutes just orienting yourself to the map and putting a game plan together. But we've also got the 20th anniversary this year, re plus. What's in store for the 20th anniversary? Absolutely,

Speaker 1  5:43  
we're really excited to be celebrating 20 years of re plus. I know many of you all probably remember us as purely solar power International, and then we added on energy storage International, and then became SPI ESI and north north american Smart Energy week. And now we are re plus, and it's been 20 years of greatness, so we are really excited about that. And one thing that we're we're going to be doing on Monday evening is having a celebration at the House of Blues. This is a ticketed event, so it's actually not included with any of the past types. So we're really excited that we'll be joined by two great musical guests, Ashley Cook, country singer, as well as Smash Mouth will also be performing, so that's on Tuesday or sorry, Monday evening, six to nine. So we, you know, invite everybody who's coming to the show to try to make it out there to House of Blues. It should be a fantastic event, and we're really excited to be celebrating 20 years. 20

Nico Johnson  6:37  
years. Congratulations to the RE plus CS SEPA Team, you guys have done a tremendous job of creating the meeting place for the industry every year, which now kind of feels like in Anaheim or Vegas next year, foreshadowing we're back in Vegas, absolutely, yeah, but this year, it's a jam packed schedule. Talk to me about how, how do you think about advising folks to orient their schedule when there's just so much they could be doing?

Speaker 1  7:08  
Yeah, in terms of orienting your schedule and getting around the campus, we have a lot of enhancements. This year, we recently launched a new app called RE plus Connect. It's going to be your key to getting around the campus and building your schedule. You have the opportunity to favorite your sessions, the exhibitors that you like, meet with other attendees. But it also provides AI powered recommendations on who some of those people should be, or those companies should be, or schedule or sessions you know should be as well. But in addition to that, it's really going to be a useful tool in terms of navigating around the campus, because there is an interactive map within that app, where you can get point to point directions. But there's also a Bluetooth function where we will have actually beacons set up around around the campus, where it will identify where you are, and then you can get from where you are to any booth or session that you're looking for

Nico Johnson  7:54  
that that will be a welcome addition next year in Vegas. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So Tim is it? Am I able to are we yet to the technology level where I could say, Okay, I want to plan my schedule such that I'm optimizing where I'm located on the show floor, and I want to meet with these 15 companies help me organize the schedule

Speaker 1  8:14  
better. If you're where you're standing now and you're trying to get to point B, it will tell you how long it takes to get there, yeah, but, and you can, theoretically, if you wanted to put in the extra, you could sit there and go when I'm in point B, then how do I get to point C? You can do that ahead of time, yeah, and sort of map that on your own. But the app isn't going to necessarily tell you that, yeah, you have, you have to be in four different places. It's only got to know from where you are at that point and then when you well, even where you're planning to go, the next area. Even then,

Nico Johnson  8:41  
I can tell you that in years past, that would have been a game changer, because you just, you can't underestimate the scale. This is just the main hall that we were looking at earlier, drilled down using the old version map your show. Because the new version hasn't as a core As of recording hasn't been fully launched for you guys to see. So it'll look very, very similar to this. But you can imagine that if you're in a meeting all the way over here, and you wanted to meet with someone all the way over here, then you have to figure out how much time that is. And what you're telling me is that I can use the app to tell me that,

Speaker 1  9:13  
yeah, you can plot in where you are, identify where you are, and then where you want to go, and it'll tell you how long it takes to get there. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  9:19  
one of the hacks that I I'll say, tips, tricks that I tell people as well as you should come in. And you can do this by logging into your Show Map and setting up your own agenda and favorites by searching the people that you want to visit, right? So if you know you want to visit, CPS, for example, you can find them exactly where they are on the show floor, back out and see kind of where that is in orientation to everyone else, and easily get a better sense of how to orient all the different vendors that you want to visit and see like, Oh, I didn't realize those guys were actually in the ballroom over in Marriott, for example, right? Which is a new addition to the show. Yeah, the Marriott ballroom, yeah, for example, there's a lot, there's a whole lot of vendors over there. Tim, how do I get to the Marriott ballroom from the convention center? Is that straightforward?

Speaker 1  10:10  
Yeah. And, you know, like I said, in addition to the app, we do have a lot of other way finding enhancements that we have this year. We do, we're actually going to have a lot of touchscreen kiosk all over the campus as well. Oh, great. I want to say 18 in total. So you can go up to them, tap on tap on the menu items there, will give you a map of where you want to go, and you can decide where you want to go. And the best thing about that, too, is that it's also the same map that's used in the app, so they cross over and you can it's the same experience that you get that's on the app you get that on the kiosk, you can also direct yourself to different sessions or exhibitors as well. So it's going to be a great tool, additional tool for people to use. But in addition to the kiosk, a few more you know, like low tech routes as well. We will have you are here maps positioned around the campus as well as printed map booklets to help people as well. If you want to go that route. On top of that, there's even more we are going to have ask me helpers around the campus as well, helping direct people, in addition to just general meetup markers, like a big solar flower or a big sign where people can reference where they want to meet up that they that they're not going to be able to miss it, because it's going to be big and bold. So when we get

Nico Johnson  11:19  
into the actual show itself, there's more than just the exhibit hall floor. There's a lot of education. Your team spends the entire year preparing for the education sessions on site. Many of the education sessions are the Full Access Pass. There are things that you can go to without a full access pass. But give me some of the highlights, like the general session, some of the things that people should know about that are happening throughout the

Speaker 1  11:39  
week. Yeah, absolutely. We're going to be kicking things off with Ari plus today, it's the general session this year. And in years past, it's been on Monday evenings. But this year it's going to be on Tuesday morning. And we're really excited to have Padma Lakshmi be the host of re plus today, she is the Emmy award nominated host of and executive producer of Hulu's taste the nation. And also, I'm sure many people also remember her on Top Chef as well. We're really excited to have her. She's going to be interviewing several representatives from around the industry, each with a unique perspective of how they are addressing solutions within the clean energy space. So that's something we really, you know, encourage people to check out. It's available to anybody in any past, any past category. After that is the master Speaker Series, and that is a special series of key industry leaders talking about insightful topics throughout the industry. And that's, you know, available to those full conference so the platinum pass holders, we encourage those with access to attend those some of the speakers that we're going to have there are jigger Shaw. He's, been a great addition. And on top of that, on Wednesday, we do have the global market summit that is available on the show floor, and so anybody with any past site can actually attend that. We got some great sessions there that people can take part in unlocking green potential and financing clean energy projects throughout international banks as well as federal finance resources for us technologies and global clean energy projects. We're going to have some representatives from the XM bank there speaking as well, as well, in addition to the Small Business Administration. So there's some really great, you know, sessions we have on the show floor, in the general sessions, in the platinum sessions, it's, it's great, you know, we you should take the time to go through the schedule beforehand and highlight the sessions that you want to attend. And then, you know, make sure you save those and then you'll have your plan for re plus this year. And I always

Nico Johnson  13:30  
ask, what is your favorite after hours? What are you most looking forward to, off the show floor, away from the venue,

Speaker 1  13:36  
off the show floor? I am definitely looking forward to the block party, which we do every year. And if you remember, in re plus 22 in Anaheim, we went to Angel Stadium, which is where we're going again this year. So super excited about that. It was a lot of fun. People had a great time. Really popular and unique experience for people at re plus so that is on Tuesday evening, and with access to for access to that that is included with that platinum pass, that full conference platinum pass, but tickets are available to anybody with the business pass or a day pass for that particular day. They can add that on and enjoying everybody at Angel Stadium, amazing.

Nico Johnson  14:13  
And then I know that the a couple of things sort of coming back to the venue that we want to make sure folks are aware of, because it's, again, beyond just solar power International, it's now, are all renewables, R, E, plus. One of the things that is a recurring venue is the horizon hydrogen Grand Prix that's happening throughout the three days that right?

Speaker 1  14:34  
The final for the horizon hydrogen Grand Prix will be, actually, on Wednesday, and it's going to be an arena Plaza. There's a whole set up there. It's a great thing to see, if you missed it last year. What it is, basically is a bunch of teenagers, and, you know, kids from around the world, they get together and build RC cars that are powered on hydrogen, and they run circuits in different races around the world, and they all come together at re plus to do the final there, and someone gets crowned the winner. So, okay. Um, it's a six hour grueling drive of RC cars powered by hydrogen, going around a great track. It's really fun to watch, um, and the kids are really into it, and obviously they're learning a lot, and so are we. So that's something, you know, I highly recommend.

Nico Johnson  15:12  
That's so cool. I'm definitely gonna make some time to go over and see that myself. I've missed it in years past, and have only seen highlights from uh, Josh and others who have had a chance to really go over and check it out. And I guess, last but not least, one of the things that you guys introduced last year that has, I think, was a crowd favorite, and for sure, you guys are bringing it back, is affinity groups. How are affinity group meetups being integrated into the schedule this year?

Speaker 1  15:34  
That's correct. We do have a lot of affinity group meetups this year like we did last year. They are gatherings and networking opportunities for different groups within the industry who are typically, typically underrepresented, can come together and discuss how their experiences are in the industry and other topics that they might find, you know, interesting to discuss with each other. Some of those groups we have this year are young professionals in clean energy, women in clean energy, black professionals in clean energy, military veterans and family and clean energy. We have a whole list. It's great. I think there's something for everybody there. They can jump in and find the gathering that they'd like to attend, and all are welcome to join and something we're excited about this year. Yeah, and I'm

Nico Johnson  16:12  
showing on the screen, but once again, if you go to the general information, which is re dash plus.com forward slash general dash information, but you can see it on screen and also easily find it. Just scroll down or click on networking and partnered events, you'll events. You'll find a lot of those. You can click through them, including you'll run right past the if you if you're not careful, some of the pathway options that you should check out. There's a bevy of information. You know, apart from planning out your day, I really do encourage you take some time, pick a weekend and go through you've really got two more left. Pick a weekend. Go through the entire re dash plus.com website, so that you can better orient yourself and enjoy what is no doubt going to be the best year yet for re plus, the biggest year yet for re plus, and lot a lot of things in store well. Tim, anything else before we go that I might have missed? Yeah,

Speaker 1  17:04  
one thing, just real quick too. When you're coming to campus this year, we'll have plenty of registration and badge pickup areas across the campus as well. So you'll have multiple areas, whether you're going to the ACC or the Marriott or the Hilton, you'll have places to pick up your badge. So really, you know, make sure you take advantage of that. And on top of that, you know you're not going to want to miss power up live, which will be outside Hall E and the ACC featuring, you know, Nico Johnson himself and Suncast media. We're proud to be partnering with Suncast again. And look, you know, you should really come by and check out the podcast stage this year.

Nico Johnson  17:39  
Tim, I want to thank you so much for five years of partnering with Suncast to produce the power up life stage. And you know, when I had this idea coming out of 2018 that you guys are so gracious to give us an opportunity in 2019 it really was a concept of For Us, By Us. And one of the things I'm super excited about is that this year, more than ever. It's not, it's not the Nico Johnson on the mic barrage that it has been in years past. There are a lot of podcasters in the industry. A lot of folks have stepped up, and there are, there's going to be a lot of really interesting conversations, both from independent podcasters, folks that you know, names that recognize, some that you might not, and the SIA and SEPA teams bringing their expertise and research teams to bear to share wonderful activity and insight and education at the power up live stage. It's more than it's more than podcasting. It is a different format. It's different venue for connecting with the thought leaders that are really driving the change in the energy transition. So wonderful. Appreciate that nod, and it's wonderful to partner with you guys year over year. Thank you for doing that. Yeah, absolutely. And thanks for being here on that. Thank you. Know, before you go episode, we I can't wait to see you in a couple of

Speaker 1  18:53  
weeks. Yeah, see you in Anaheim, and hope everyone's there too.

Nico Johnson  18:57  
Eric holvic is Associate Director of Business Development at EnergySage, and up until about three and a half years ago, had never had the opportunity to really attend industry trade shows. Eric, welcome to Suncast.

Unknown Speaker  19:10  
Thanks for having me. My

Nico Johnson  19:11  
understanding is that when you jumped into the solar industry with EnergySage, you finally got a chance to actually go to these, these, these wild beasts called trade shows. How have Have you seen the Well, how's the experience evolved for you over the last three or so years? This be your fourth, I think, re plus, yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  19:32  
I've been to a lot of different trade shows, from the regional re pluses, abceps to now re plus the formerly known SPI, and it has grown from the last three years, I think it has doubled or tripled in size, which has been crazy to see the growth. But it's also exciting to see how much the solar industry has grown in the last three three and a half years. However long I've been in this industry, and I'm sure how long have you been in the industry, it's grown even tenfold from there. To right? So it's just it continues to grow, which is just fascinating to me. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  20:05  
I joked that I was not even a joke. I was actually a volunteer scanning badges. You know, those people at the door in 2006 when I was running my own company so that I could get a free ticket to the show. And I think total attendance was under 5000 and last year, I think it was over 40,000 this year, they expect 50,000 plus, so 10x growth in the, you know, 18 years that I've been I think this is my 17th or 18th re plus. I'm curious as a, you know, as a industry information platform, connecting the dots and data for 1000s of installers and millions of homeowners. How do you all think about the role that of trade shows like this play for industry cohesion and also just data gathering? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:57  
it's a really good question. And what I believe it does is it very much brings everyone together to have these conversations as a group that typically do not happen. And what that happens is, as people walk past the booth, they end up having a conversation, exchange numbers, business cards, virtual business cards. Now to have those conversations and then follow up afterwards, but it really becomes more of a think tank, especially with the sessions that are happening, the networking after the sessions, the happy hours, all of these different events really just allow everyone in the industry to collaborate and come together and share ideas, because they're not working for those three or four days,

Nico Johnson  21:37  
yeah, well, they're Not working on the business specifically, right? They're working on all of the the connective tissue that helps the business stay engaged with the industry. I think it's one of those essential for me. It's essential. It always surprises me when someone is not sending their team to re plus, especially the business development team. I know that's something that is just part and parcel to how you manage those relationships, that ability to press the flesh, to get face time with those folks that perhaps you've only ever had zoom calls with. How are you preparing your team as you gear up here in the month ahead of re plus, yeah, we're

Unknown Speaker  22:14  
we're doing a few things. Is one, making sure that we're putting out some social posts, have some meetings in the books, but also making sure that everyone on the team blocks off time to walk around the expo hall to learn what's happening, what's new in the industry that they haven't seen this year or years before, but just have conversations and understand that a lot of their networking and new business opportunities is going to come from happy hours or networking events, yeah, the show floor not bumping into someone on the expo hall, because that's like looking for a needle in the haystack.

Nico Johnson  22:51  
Yeah, I wonder do with regards to actually walking the show floor, how have you improved that activity to be sort of a maximal experience for you. And what do you? What do you? What kind of tips do you

Unknown Speaker  23:07  
give your team? Yeah, I tell them, start with a manufacturer that you know and that you have a contact there, and start walking your way over there. And if you get sidetracked, you get sidetracked. But yeah, pick a destination. Try to walk in a straight line, and good luck, and see how far you can go. That's very

Nico Johnson  23:23  
interesting. And certainly the longer your industry in industry, the more times you will get stopped between start and destination. That much is to be expected. You know, one of the things that a lot of folks turn to EnergySage for is the data that you gather and the information that you extrapolate from it. Are you all presenting anything interesting this year at the show, and if so, when, where? Who should we queue up in our schedule? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:45  
So my colleague, Emily Walker, she's our senior writer for energy sage, will be speaking at a session called batteries, included transforming homes into resilient power hubs. That's happening on Wednesday, 11 to 12. I think it's 209, A, B, level two on the convention center. Fantastic.

Nico Johnson  24:04  
All right. Now, as you mentioned, not all the useful activity is on the exhibit hall floor or even in the the classrooms. A lot of it happens after hours. What's your must attend after party at re plus, I

Unknown Speaker  24:21  
think we all know what it is. I mean, it's, it's got to be Fight Club at the end of the day, everyone has to go to it. If you haven't reserved, you might as well reserve it now, because that's the session to go to. That is the networking event. Everyone will never miss it once you go once, yeah, yeah. What's

Nico Johnson  24:38  
funny is, I'm having been on the organizing committee for a while of solar Fight Night, organized by solar, by solar Fight Club. Everybody always asks, Are there real fighting and there are? There are going to be a few fun surprises this year. No actual like slug. Fest, but a few fun surprises on actually in the venue, because we've got a much bigger venue this year than we've had in years past. There may or may not be an actual boxing ring. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  25:10  
love that. I already got messages from a couple installers already asking me, like, are you gonna be a fight club? Am I gonna see you there? Like, don't worry. I'll be there. Don't worry about it. So I hope to see you there and everyone else who's listening to this too. I'm

Nico Johnson  25:24  
sorry you'll you'll find me in my purple jumpsuit, walking around the show, treating people, making sure everyone's having a good time. Well, the other place you'll be spending a lot of time is the energy sage booth. For those who want to combine, give you a high five ahead of the fight night festivities. Where will they? Come find you. EnergySage,

Unknown Speaker  25:42  
we're located at sea, 43 103, back of Hall, sea by the sea beer garden. So come join us for a drink. Join us for a couple interviews. Have a conversation. We'd be thrilled to see you.

Nico Johnson  25:57  
Yeah, and as you just pointed out, EnergySage, as per usual, will have their crew on site doing interviews in their booth, 80% of the booth dedicated to their video team. Swing by see if you've got anything interesting to share that they'd want to put on tape. Maybe, who knows, you'll end up on the EnergySage YouTube channel as well. Who knows? Eric, I look forward to seeing you in Anaheim. Sounds good. See you there. As re plus has grown, so has the interest from outside the industry, not just from media, but from big tech and even big nonprofits. Well, big and small, you might say, folks are interested in how sustainability and access to clean energy affects our life and our livelihood. I've been as a lifetime climber, at least as an adult, lifelong climber, I've been super interested in a certain rising media star, none other than Alex Honnold. What many of you may not be aware of is how Alex and his Honnold Foundation are contributing to energy equity throughout developing nations. Here to talk a little bit more about honmel Foundation and their presence at re plus. Is the Executive Director of honmel Foundation, Emily tightsworth, Emily, great to see you.

Unknown Speaker  27:09  
Thanks so much for having me. We're super excited for this and really excited to meet you at re plus in a few short weeks.

Nico Johnson  27:15  
Yeah, likewise, I can't believe it is just around the corner. Emily, have you been to re plus before this is going

Unknown Speaker  27:21  
to be our first time. So neither Alex nor myself or any of our partners have actually attended before. So this is a big year for us,

Nico Johnson  27:28  
amazing and we're going to talk a bit about about kind of how to optimize the experience at the show. So I know that not only are you now a contributor, but you'll be a listener of the Know Before You Go episode, I've been guilty of saying that there are a few people I would fanboy. Alex Honnold happens to fall in that category of someone that I actually, legitimately in real life follow. Been really excited at their coverage on his podcast, climbing gold, which I think everyone should subscribe to, about the you know, climbing in its second time now in the Olympics, and he actually got a chance to go and and do some interviews, which is fun for olympics.com. I think it's a huge step forward for our industry and for the show to have people that I recognize as media stars like Alex on site. So we're excited that Alex is going to join us at the power up live stage on Tuesday morning as we have our opening morning show at 10am I would invite everyone to come out and and get a chance to see and perhaps even meet Alex. He's going to be between two key activities there. But I'm curious, Emily, when you guys think about the places where Alex's time and attention could be, could be invested. Why is now the right time for Alex to be present at the major trade show known as re plus? You

Unknown Speaker  28:50  
know, the Honnold Foundation has been around now for coming on 12 years. Alex started the foundation when he was still living in his van, and he started climbing all around the world and really saw what it looked like for people to either have no access to energy or to rely on things like diesel generators or coal for their energy needs. And so, you know, he's been a long time proponent of solar in his personal life, and realized that early on, you know, he could make a commitment to philanthropy and to giving back outside of his climbing, and he really just thought that solar was this sort of catalytic solution and a way that he could invest in the future of both communities and the environment in a sustainable way. And so he's been involved in the industry in different ways for a long time, and as the Hono Foundation has grown, we've started to expand our partnerships with groups in the industry, Lark like rec Americas and soul systems and others. And so we have been looking for an opportunity to just engage more directly with these other groups, from the government, from corporate backgrounds and other nonprofits that are doing this work. And re plus is the perfect place to do that.

Nico Johnson  29:58  
I think. Think that the first time I heard about hunnel Foundation, it was in the context probably speaking with Carrie Hayes about the partnership with Rec, and it's been really tremendous, I know to see how you all have partnered with Rec for the outreach that you've done in Puerto Rico and other areas. Is it true? Like, what's the percentage? I think it's a public number that Alex actually uses of his own funds to support the foundation. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:25  
So when he was, you know, just starting out, and, you know, not making a lot of money, before free solo, the big documentary, came out, he made this commitment to donate a third of his annual income to charity. And so he contributes to about, you know, a third of his income each year, to the hollow foundation and to our grantee partners doing solar energy work. So pretty incredible.

Nico Johnson  30:47  
That is beautiful. You're gonna have, uh, after Alex leaves the uh morning show, which is at our power up life stage in the in the lobby of Hall E, for anyone that wants to come see you, you all will be going immediately to a Master series, a master Speaker Series, where Carrie, Hayes, Marcy and Alex Honnold will be speaking on the work that you all are doing together. What's the nature of that session, and what would folks want to know to intrigue them to come over and watch that?

Unknown Speaker  31:16  
Yeah, so Alex and Carrie have been friends for a long time. Carrie's been a big partner and supporter of the Honnold Foundation. They both do in kind donations and financial support mainly focused on our indigenized communities and tribal communities that we work with around the country. And so we are going to use this as a way to kind of highlight the friendship that they've had and how that's grown through their partnership around solar energy innovation and investing in marginalized communities. And then we're really excited after their conversation, to bring on three of our grantee partner organizations to have a conversation with Alex about their work. So our main focus is supporting organizations that are working in marginalized communities, using solar for community development and conservation. And so we're going to be featuring three organizations, one from North Dakota, one from New Orleans, and one from New Mexico, that are really leading community solar innovation, and they've gotten support from the Honolulu foundation for the last couple years. So excited to transition from that conversation between Alex and Carrie, which I think should be really exciting in its own right, to really hearing directly from frontline grassroots leaders as well.

Nico Johnson  32:30  
Amazing. The other thing that I'm really excited about, and I'm grateful to our mutual friend Aaron Greeson, for helping make the connection, is most here have at least heard once that solar Fight Night is the party that you all should be prioritizing. It is the largest philanthropic nonprofit activity happening at Ari plus, and we like to call it the Met Gala for solar. And this year and every year, we choose at least one nonprofit. This year we've chosen three that will be recipients of the proceeds from solar Fight Night. I guess a lot of folks know that it's a giant gathering and networking event of the year. It's a big it's a big party and but very, I think very few folks know that the money from the proceeds actually go to nonprofits. And this year, we've selected three nonprofits, among them, the Honnold Foundation, and gonna actually look forward to beyond having a chance to interview Alex at the morning show and see he and Carrie at their panel. We'll have you all, your whole team from honold Foundation, including Alex at solar Fight Night. That is, that's happening on Tuesday night. For those who haven't already bought your tickets, we'll link to it in the show notes. It's the 10th from 10pm to 2am for those of you who like to stay out late, will be at City national growth, but I can promise you, if you don't buy your tickets in advance, you won't get in. There have been tons of people left at the door each and every year. So make sure you buy the tickets. We'll put the link to the tickets the event bright down in the show notes below, Emily, I'm looking forward to meeting you all in person. I'm pretty stoked, frankly, to get a chance to meet the whole hon Foundation team and Alex Honnold himself. Thank you for bringing attention to not just what solar power can offer in energy equity, but how a committed, you know, I've said before, like a media star, but somebody who's a committed athlete and a public figure like Alex is choosing to dedicate part of their hard earned proceeds to this, this, you know, this area of energy inequity, and in particular, with indigenous communities. Thank you for all that you guys do.

Unknown Speaker  34:42  
Thank guys do. Thank you so much. We're really looking forward to it, and we're looking forward to partying for a great cause on Tuesday night. So thanks so much.

Nico Johnson  34:49  
Next up, we've got Mike Munsell, VP of partnerships at heatmap news. Many of you probably know Mike from his many years in the industry at other publications, most recently joining the. Get on the block heat map news as the head of partnerships, leading sales and growth efforts over at what has become one of my daily readers. Mike, good to see you. Good to see you too. And

Unknown Speaker  35:10  
thank you for reading heat map. My

Nico Johnson  35:12  
pleasure. Thank you for inviting me to read heat map. It is. You guys have such a truly a wealth of knowledge in the staff there. I mean, I think the email that I open most frequently is Emily's daily email. Sometimes I get a chance to read Robinson, but I'm looking forward to reading more from it's, is it ya? L, is

Unknown Speaker  35:34  
that is that how you JL, yeah. Came over for Max, yes.

Nico Johnson  35:37  
So excited. Yeah. So JL is covering solar and renewables, right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:43  
really at a project level, we're really interested in sort of the intersection of developing projects and the local community pushback against them, and just that, the drama behind that and all the policies around it. So she's gonna be covering that really closely.

Nico Johnson  36:00  
That's cool. We need to get her in a meeting with Mike Casey at the show, of course, because that's my bailiwick right there. I'll make sure that happens, because Mike's gonna be spending a lot of time at powerup live with us. But it's your I think 10th anniversary at the show, am I right?

Unknown Speaker  36:15  
It is. Yes, I miss one year for the birth of my first he was an August baby, so we did make the September show, and then covid happened, so this will be year number 10. Officially

Nico Johnson  36:28  
amazing. It's so a decade of experience that we all get to glean from. You know, given that you've been covering the industry from a news perspective, pretty much daily for the bulk of your career. How do you and feel free to extrapolate as well out to sort of the broader heat map team. How do you all think about covering a major trade show like re plus? What are you looking for? What are some of the trends that you expect will unfurl during the week, and where do you expect the conversations to land?

Unknown Speaker  37:03  
Yeah, and just the caveat that I'm not on the journalist side, totally Get aside. So I will speak roughly for them, but not for them at all, actually. I mean, I think that this year in particular, and maybe this is sort of a stock answer for the last two years, with the IRA right being front and center, but with the upcoming election in November, and you know now with Harris on the ticket, it really is up in the air. What happens in November, and what does that mean for the IRA? And I can imagine that many of the conversations on the show floor will be in that regard. And our journalists are certainly curious about the people on the ground, whether they're developers, at utilities, solar, manufacturers, what do they think? What are they hearing? Because, you know, it could go either way, and you know, there's a lot of red states who are getting a lot of great benefits and jobs from the IRA. So what? What does that all mean? Come 2025 when I think that's going to be the biggest trend on the show for is my, my hunch.

Nico Johnson  38:08  
How many folks from heat map going to be walking the

Unknown Speaker  38:10  
show? So we'll have, I believe, four of us. Four, it's

Nico Johnson  38:14  
you on do, basically walking around. Meme partners, jail.

Unknown Speaker  38:19  
There's jail, correct? And then we'll have Nico lorcello, who's the editor and editor in chief and CEO. And then we'll have Zach Silber, who runs our heat map pro product. And then Alex, who's on his team on the pro side.

Nico Johnson  38:34  
Fantastic Pro. Having gotten a chance to look under the hood is very reminiscent, in scope of like, the old GTM squared, right? Like people in the industry at least, would recognize that as a product. So it's one of those things that I think I highly recommend. When I talk to people, ask them, like, Hey, are you a heat map reader? And if they are, I asked them if they're aware of the pro product. So I think increasingly, you guys are getting better traction and penetration there, given that a decade in you, I presume you have a strategy for how you spend your time. You know, not everybody going is a project developer, not everybody going as a B to B marketer or or product company. So we in the know, before you go episode, want to help folks think more broadly about how to best utilize their time. Any particular tips or tricks that you've found help you maximize your experience at re plus,

Unknown Speaker  39:28  
yeah, it's a mix of organization and planning ahead and also giving yourself the time and flexibility to just go with the flow, right? There's a really healthy balance between and I don't know when this episode drops, but I imagine it's pretty close to the show. So if you haven't started booking meetings by the time you're listening, you should really get on that. You know, don't give yourself back to back meetings by any stretch, but people's calendars do fill up very fast, so definitely make sure you're sort of on, on the books and on the radar for your key prospects. Yeah. But then, you know, the show floor is so big and it takes time from meeting to meeting, and a lot of serendipity happens, sort of in between one meeting and the next. So make sure you give yourself ample time in between.

Nico Johnson  40:14  
Yeah. I want to just drill down double click on that one piece. It has never been bigger than this year. This last year was the biggest attendance. But if we talk about total square footage covered this year is mind numbingly big. It is North Hall over kind of in the Hilton area. It is an entire conference room at the Marriott plus, not just ABC Convention Center halls, which we're all familiar with if you've been to previous re plus. And just to contextualize this last, last time we had an RE plus, it was basically ABC and a little bit of D. This time it is all of ABCD, which is the entire first floor that people are familiar with. Plus the entire hall E, which is underneath Hall D, which is right where the power of live stage lobby is basically so that entire building, plus the walk up to the arena, I think, to actually have things happening in the arena, it is incredibly big. So as Mike said, don't underestimate the time required to walk from meeting to meeting. My personally advice, personal advice is never booked two back to back meetings ever at the trade show ever, like, always leave at least 30 minutes between the end of one meeting and the start of the next. Always, there's very little hope that you'll make it from one meeting to the next if they end it, you know, 55 and the next one starts at the top of the hour. So that is a critical failure. I see people doing. And then the other thing that you pointed out was plan to walk the show. A lot of folks will go, and they'll try to pick out the vendors they want to visit, or maybe the partners that they want to meet with. I find that one of the things they don't do is look at the show map ahead of time as they're thinking about that schedule. So you could go to and we'll link to the map my show show floor in the Episode Notes, before you call your prospects or customers and make those bookings look to see, are they in the Marriott? Are they in Hall C? We have a couple of Back to Back meetings where, thankfully, I don't have to be the start of the meeting, but it's like I have to run from Hall D to the arena and and it's a little run. It takes five minutes to get from one spot

Unknown Speaker  42:25  
to the other. This scale of it is really hard to comprehend. Comprehend until you live it. We brought the heat map team to clean power, which was in April, and they had 10,000 people at that and they were just blown away. That was their first renewal trade show for many of them. I mean, just, like, just wait till we go to Anaheim,

Nico Johnson  42:46  
yeah, just going to be truly bonkers. Like, not next year is going to be pretty wild and going back to Vegas, and also it'll be almost assuredly, you know, 60 or more 1000 people this year. They're expecting 50 plus. Well, as we know, the activity on the show floor is not everything that happens during the RE plus trade show week. Mike, do you have any lineup yet for your evening activities? As I find most of the networking happens after hours,

Unknown Speaker  43:14  
yeah, and that's some of the serendipity. I was referring to. The after hours shows are packed with people, and there are so many events going on. Check your emails. You're probably getting event invites right now. I know the shoals party is a big one every year. That's happening Wednesday night I heard in which I have a red high flying home, so I probably won't make that

Nico Johnson  43:37  
one, but your body. Thanks you for

Unknown Speaker  43:41  
I have a wedding Sunday night here before I fly out, so I have I'm going to be tired, yeah, big, big weekend, yes, but try to make it to the event, try to get some sleep, because they ultimately will be late nights. But oftentimes the conversations that you have during dinner during the evening hours are just as impactful as those you have on the show floor. So Stay on your game.

Nico Johnson  44:09  
I'll channel our inner Abby hopper. We had Abby on a couple of years ago. She said, You know, I just want to encourage everyone to remember that we're adults. Go to bed like you're at home if you can, and drink water like your body needs it and and for the most part, you'll make it through the day. Okay. People that we see lagging are the ones that either stayed out too late and or decided that they are a camel and don't need to drink water all day. Definitely remember to hydrate and get plenty of sleep. I think that while I always advocate that folks come to our solar fight night party, and it is a huge highlight for many of us during the week, I personally make it a goal to go to a fight night and still be home in my bed by midnight. Not always possible, but definitely do. Double Mike,

Unknown Speaker  45:00  
I look forward to great, great bedtime at re plus, it is like

Nico Johnson  45:04  
if you can hit the midnight goal, then I say you're winning. Well, Mike, I for 1am, very much looking forward to seeing you in person again, meeting more of the heatmap news team. And I know that I can count on the coverage from jail and the team after the show to hear more of the heatmap perspective on how the show went. Thanks for joining us.

Unknown Speaker  45:23  
Thanks so much. And I'll be sure to pop by the booth and listen to your show. All

Nico Johnson  45:28  
right. Rounding out our annual Know Before You Go episode, I will go last with the person that you will see first when you get to Anaheim, my co host of the power up live morning show, Lisa Ann Pinkerton, Lisa, good to see you.

Unknown Speaker  45:41  
Hi Nico, good to see you, too. I'm excited for this year.

Nico Johnson  45:44  
I'm so excited. You know, last year, through some serendipitous, fortuitous turns of events, you came in and joined me as the host, the co host, of our power of live morning show. I've never been so prepared as I am with Lisa and writing, I feel like I'm writing shotgun with you, to be honest.

Unknown Speaker  46:06  
Now, I know I get invited to be the co host.

Nico Johnson  46:10  
You know, it's, you know, it's fun. I think you probably mentioned you probably noticed this, but even our team, I they were like, where did this run of show come from? I was like, well, she's the CEO of a comms company. You know, Technica communications is her company. And they were like, can we use it? So, like, the run of show that you created became our entire, like, power of live stage, run of show. Oh, that's awesome, yeah. So thank you for that, that gift. But you've also given gifts in many other ways, notably, you in the past life. We're at NPR. Am I right? That's correct, yes, which is why, folks, if you're listening to this podcast, you hear the sultry tones of Lisa Ann Pinkerton, raise your hand if you are a earthlings podcast listener. So Lisa Ann is also the host of the Earthlings podcast earthlings 2.0 which is part of our resource labs Podcast Network. If you're not a listener, you can easily find and connect with her, not only on LinkedIn, but through our show notes, or go to resource labs.co without further ado, let's talk about re plus. So we've got the power up live morning show, Lisa, and since you've done a fair amount of preparing with me, how do you tell people what the morning show is when you're telling them they should come watch it?

Unknown Speaker  47:25  
I I

Unknown Speaker  47:26  
describe it as sort of the the Regis and Kathy Lee opening of the day for re plus. And I don't mean that, like, flippantly, we, like, there's, there's actually we, I think we provide a lot more information than you might get on a, you know, morning talk show like that, but there's, I like our rapport, and it's light, and it's, you know, you're going to get plenty of heavy information throughout the day, but this is the light overview to wake you up, inspire you, hype you up, you know, get you ready for the day, because you're going to need a lot of energy to carry you through all night. Absolutely,

Nico Johnson  48:02  
the morning show evolved out of a what became a very impromptu thing I did with Glenda Johnson all the way back at our first podcast stage in 2019 in Salt Lake, Glenda and I did like a pop up show on re pluses, Instagram Live. And the following year, we were like, we really should do this as a segment, and we've done it every year. Julia Piper, at one time, was my morning Morning Show co host, and the morning show was actually modeled. It's so funny that you mentioned Regis and Kathleen. That's exactly how I think of it as well. I tell some people like, it's like, Good Morning America, but it's good morning re plus it happens to be the first thing on the schedule and the first thing at the power of life stage, but it immediately this year follows. We kick off following the general session. So a lot of folks will go to the general session, but because we get jumbotron time, we moved the start time from our normal 30 minutes before the show floor opens to to the time the show floor opens. And Lisa and I think you had a very clever idea that we've been wanting to do for a couple of years. So do you want to announce how and why, or why people would want to come over to the power up live stage before they go roam the exhibit hall floor,

Unknown Speaker  49:15  
well beyond all the great information that they're going to get so that they can sound very smart and up to date on the news of the day while they're mingling the show floor in the various sessions, is that we're going to have a Bloody Mary bar. Yeah, something I've been I've been advocating for years, and Nico, you're the first person to take me up on it. So I'm very excited to see how this plays

Nico Johnson  49:38  
out. As AM, I will definitely have we know that the RE plus 20th anniversary party is Monday night, because that's the opening night party, and so we anticipate that as well, others are going to go a little too hard on the first night. So come recover, we will have an until it runs out, style blood. Mary bar. So it is not an unlimited Bloody Mary bar. We're not doing it to try to get leads. We're doing it to try to attract folks to come over and watch our morning show. So shamelessly, I will say that when, when the Bloody Mary runs out, you will not be able to get one, nevertheless, you will be able to nourish yourself with the content that we provide, and our goal is to give you a good a good foundation, a good sense of how to kick the show off, and we do it every morning. So it's 10 o'clock on Tuesday and then nine o'clock on Wednesday and Thursday. Actually, no, it's 930 on Wednesday and Thursday. Good news is it's in the official schedule, so even if I totally mess up on telling you what the time is. You can find it in the schedule. Yeah, Lisa, and I've been told that some one of the favorites from last year that has been requested by many to return is another brilliant idea that you had last year, the swag contest. What's the deal with the swag contest? And you know, I don't know that we haven't answered this yet, but the question I got asked was, What do you win? Like, if you win the swag contest, I

Unknown Speaker  51:06  
will you definitely win bragging rights. That's right, yeah. And, you know, we'll do a little promotion, I'm

Nico Johnson  51:13  
sure that's right. And you win, you definitely. So everyone, almost everyone, practically, you know, we basically go through a bunch of the swag and say, like, here are good ideas. But also, effectively, you win your brand and your swag being shown on the Jumbotron. We even have, we developed last year a sort of let's show some of our favorite swag in their daily roundup at the end of the day. Because every day, at the end of the day, at five o'clock, we do a 30 minute segment called the daily Roundup, which is about what's happening tomorrow and what happened, what trends are happening on the show floor, the what announcements were made today that you should be aware of. And my my daily roundup co hosts love to sort of pick through the swag and tell what their favorite ones are, too. So it's a gratuitous way for us to just brag about the good swag. And we do cherry pick, because if you don't have good swag, you don't get mentioned. So your goal should be to get mentioned, and effectively, because we're broadcasting on the Jumbotron, you can definitely get your brand out there in front of others and and I know last year, like novatos had this really cool speaker, and they ended up, like, running out of them, because

Unknown Speaker  52:35  
we we said that we loved it. And there was, there was a lot. There was one

Nico Johnson  52:39  
that Nate Giovanelli was talking about, like he got an actual shoe. Remember that he got, like, a pair of Nikes, and so I think that was the now snowball. I think they had this promotion for these Nikes that were, like personalized Nikes, and they ran out because we sent people over there. So it does end up driving traffic to people's booths. And again, for our purposes, like we just want to have fun with it, because we believe that marketing is truly important, and so many people throw money away and bad swag. So what's an example of good swag? And this is, you know, I'll say thank you to Solis, because they actually sent us a whole bunch of these batteries. And this has got the MagSafe charger on the back, and it is a 10,000 kilowatt hour or 10,000 milliamp hour battery. That's an example of good swag, one that I use it just so happens that both of my examples, standing sitting beside me are black and orange. AP systems has like, this, super cool. You have to be watching this on YouTube, but they have this, like, lay flat, stand, basically that again. Like it goes in my backpack. I

Unknown Speaker  53:39  
keep it. I gave that to my fiance. He uses it every day. I use it all the time. That's an example of that swag people. Oh, the Technica swag from live. Here

Nico Johnson  53:48  
it goes, in mind. That goes, that goes, seriously, I not no organizer inside the Technica swag bag hat, where were these beautiful Orange Socks? I wear them on basically every trip I go on. They're in my bag to go to DC tonight, and as is the technical bag, because it's now my DOP kit, because my DOP kit broke, and so you are, you provided me with a brand new DOP kit, which is absolutely beautiful and functional, and I appreciate it so. And that's

Unknown Speaker  54:15  
the key. That's the key about the swag contest. It's, it's, it's something that's unusual or unique or something that's really useful that we know is going to laugh, that's right. So much of the swag out there is just, it's just, it's commonly done, and that's fine, but it's the stuff that's unusual and unique, and people are going to use it throughout the year. That's what makes good swag, because the brand you're, you're reintegrating your brand into the mindset of the person who has that product day in and day out. And

Nico Johnson  54:45  
I can tell you, I think about those two companies all the time, because they're always on my desk. I see it every single day, and that that really should be the goal is to be ever to be there present. But you, Lisa Ann in one of our first Noble for you episodes. Gave some really tactical advice for how to maximize your time at the trade show, in particular, with regards to networking and just sort of inner physical energy. I'd love for you to help revisit that, because I feel like you've got, you've got it on lock.

Unknown Speaker  55:12  
So physical energy, it's about, obviously, getting enough sleep at night, if you can. I have started setting an alarm on my phone or for the time that I need to leave the party I'm at now, do I actually leave when it tells me No, but at least now I've got a little bug in my ear that says, Okay, you really need to start going home and thinking about getting some sleep. And now that I got to get up in the morning and do the morning show with you, Nico, I really need to get some sleep. My beauty rest so very important. But regardless of that, it's, it's making sure you get your vegetables, because there's not going to be a lot on the show floor. It's going to be mostly carbs, so protein vegetables, those are going to keep you going throughout the day. Make sure you take your supplements, take your, you know, whatever immunity support that you would do because you're starting to feel sick, just go ahead and take that because you're going to get exhausted, dehydrated. So drink a lot of water as well. If you don't bring a water bottle, there's going to be plenty of swag water bottles around. Grab one and be fastidious about that liquid IV is really great in your water bottle. It's going to keep you hydrated and wear comfortable shoes. Ladies specifically talking to you, let's have a tennis shoe culture here. Yes, we don't need, we don't need to be wearing fancy shoes on the show floor.

Nico Johnson  56:31  
You also have, like, a very specific strategy for business cards. And let's face it, like one of the things that, if you haven't already print plenty of business cards, should take at least 500 business cards with you, and your plan is not to your plan really is to get rid of those business cards like distribute them everywhere you can. But also, as you collect business cards, I find that most people don't have a strategy for that. Lisa Anne, what do

Unknown Speaker  56:53  
you do? So my strategy is I've got two pockets now. Might be in my bag, might be on my purse, and whatever the case might be. One pocket is the a group, and the other pockets, the B group, the a group, are the people that I want to remember and I'm going to follow up with. And those are potential leads or something very interesting. I like those people. I want to create friendships with them, etc, etc. So then when I get home or back to the hotel, I have on the on the on the table, you know, my A and B group. And typically I will respond to people that night if I can Wow, and I meet and I actually will schedule the email to go out the Monday after the show.

Nico Johnson  57:30  
Oh, wow. Okay, of course, because they're not reading their email,

Unknown Speaker  57:34  
they're gonna forget. But if I don't do it right away, it's very difficult for me to do it once I get back to the office, the follow up. I have one more. This is a new one that I'm employing this year because I had such trouble last year with all of the different floors and venues for various where all the booths are. This year, what I'm doing is I'm not depending on the internet whatsoever, because it's going to be clogged. Bandwidth is going to be hard. So I'm having a no, I'm creating a notes document on my phone with a checklist of each of the booths that I want to visit, right, and what Hall they're in. So if I've got 10 minutes before my next meeting and I'm in Hall B, where am I be? Where it's my B group, and I'll go visit them, I'll get so consumed and overwhelmed that I'll just, I'll just go visit any booth, yeah, and then at the end of the week, I'm like, Oh crap. I really wanted to go see that company, and I totally didn't

Nico Johnson  58:31

Unknown Speaker  58:52  
that's, that's when you really get a chance to meet people in a more casual setting and and get a chance to make friends with folks. Because, let's face it, you can do business with anybody, but you're going to do really great business with people that you can build rapport with and have a friendship connection to, because there's that those business relationships are so fruitful and solar. Fight nights such a great event. The the organizations that the proceeds go to is, is just, they're doing wonderful stuff. And it's, it's a real it's a really good party, like, let your hair down, and you never know who's going to be an excellent break dancer.
