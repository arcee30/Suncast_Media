I tell people, if you want to run a 5k, you probably don't need to coach, if you want to win the 5k, you absolutely need a coach, if you want to run a Tough Mudder, you probably don't need a coach, if you want to set a PR in your next Tough Mudder you probably need a coach. So it's a question of aspiration, you know, and where you seek to gain advantage and improve on yourself and your business and how how you surround yourself with the right tools matters in terms of how long it takes. And whether or not you can get there is not usually a question for most entrepreneurs, it's how long will it take? And how much pain will I endure?

Speaker 1  0:43  
That's the I think the last thing is like, man, sometimes you just need help to get off the struggle bus, right? Yes, we as entrepreneurs, I that's part of the adrenaline that we get. But it doesn't have to be as painful.

Nico Johnson  1:00  
Welcome back solo warriors. This is tactical Tuesday practical guidance to get you into a place of building your career and your business with the tools that you need, discerning what products you use, or what frameworks help you build the team and the business that is going to take your idea out in the world, we are on the frontlines of the clean energy transition. And as a leader, you need to equip yourself. That's what tactical Tuesday is all about. I honor you for taking the only non renewable resource you've gotten investing in here. And that is your time, I promise that we are going to give you a great return for it. If you had a moment to listen, if you are subscribed to the show, and you cued it up the interview several months ago with Bob and Maria Kingery. Here in North Carolina, some local solar Legends was one that fascinated me for a number of reasons. And I tabled at the time, a conversation with Maria, about how she has evolved beyond southern energy management, the business that she and Bob had built for the last 20 plus years into coaching. And I know that many of you have both used and loved coaching others have avoided and perhaps even besmirched it. And so several more are just curious and have certainly considered somewhere in the back of your mind. Would I need coaching? At what point? We're going to talk about that today? My friend Maria Kingery has a couple of decades of this business building experience. And, in fact, the last five plus years, she's been an EOS implementer. You're probably familiar with EOS from books like rocket fuel and traction from Gina Whitman. But there are more frameworks. And Maria has explored many of them. The evolution of her coaching practice is why I wanted to have Maria here on the show to dig in with me and help you get a little more clarity about whether or not coaching is right for you. But also, what are the tools that helped to serve the framework the foundation for a thriving business? And how do coaches help to get you along the path. Drawing from her experience as the co founder and chief impact Officer of southern energy management. Maria has helped dozens of other business leaders exactly this way. And she's helped guide southern energy management a B Corp into a successful and thriving solar company here in North Carolina. So you're in good hands. And if you like conversations like this with leaders on the frontlines of the energy transition well, I hope that you will tune in for more episodes and that you'll subscribe to the show, because we have them twice weekly, tactical practical advice just like today's episode and long form executive profiles like the one we did with the king Reese a few months ago. But for now let's get ready to tune up your skills solo warrior as we tune into another practical, tactical advice filled session here on SunCast. Well, Maria, it is so good to see you again. Even though it may sound strange for folks that we both live within 20 minutes of one another, we don't get a chance to really hang out that much. Welcome to SunCast.

Unknown Speaker  4:12  
Thank you, Nick guards. Good to be with you again.

Nico Johnson  4:15  
I really got a sense in the conversations that we had leading up to the interview with you and Bob, that there are perhaps dozens of companies who have leaned in to your guidance and counseling to help them either move past specific roadblocks unlock sort of organizational capacity, or just make critical path decisions that they perhaps wouldn't have been able to accomplish in other ways. And so I wanted to talk today about the concept at a high level of coaching, but also the frameworks and some of the practical advice that businesses have given advice some of the practical guidance that comes from having an out Side viewpoint on the business. From the outset, I think a lot of folks ask the question at some point in their entrepreneurial career, do I need a coach? Why would I need a coach? Are they just lambasted? Because that's for, you know, those weak folks who who can't get shit done? Kim, let's just hit the out of the gate. From your perspective, what's the value of having an a counselor, a coach, a guide, like yourself, for a business owner,

Speaker 1  5:28  
there are many Nikko. And I will say one of my clients gave me the best, like Zinger, a phrase that I think describes it perfectly. And she said, you can't read the label from inside the jar, you know, we were the same as others, we just met him. And the reason that I evolved and became a coach was because of the value that we got from it. And the value came from having somebody who was not, didn't have a self interest. And the success of the organization wasn't getting a paycheck, of course, they were being compensated. But who could tell us the things that we had not been able to or in some cases refuse to see. I can remember several times. And now of course, I've had these experiences with my own clients where, say, there's the thing that you know, you need to do, but you're just not doing it, and having someone who can, you know, just like executive coaching or any type of coaching, having someone hold up that mirror and say, hey, you know, do you

Nico Johnson  6:44  
see this? There's two things that resonate for me there one, I'll go in reverse order great questions. The folks that I know who are coaches, in an intuitive way, have learned to ask good questions and do sense have a sense for intuiting? What is the right next question? Because each one is levers that can move someone in a particular direction, it's a, it's a, it's a divert way to move into and out of a conversation in gentle or sometimes abrupt ways. But the other is the mirror. And when I talk to coaching clients or prospects, folks that have reached out and asked if I can sort of help them get clarity on one topic or another, I use the mirror analogy similar to the label. But I say, you know, if you aren't going to very few guys, I know shave without a mirror. Even though you know your face. And especially if like me, you have an actual structured beard, rather than just a clean shaven face. You need a mirror, you need to know did I get the line, right? And my shaping this in a way that is going to be pleasing to Me and then to others. And I as a coach, am that mirror, right? I don't try to tell them what the beard should look like. I try to help them see their beard for what it is and sculpt it in the way that they've told me that they imagined it could

Speaker 1  8:06  
look. Right. Yeah. Just to build on your analogy. Mica. I was sure. You know, there are different styles of beards, right? I mean, you know, there, everyone is gonna have their own unique style because of their face, right? However, talking with someone or looking at a photograph, or you know, having someone to teach you how to manage, and how to get the result that you want, right, maybe the other thing that comes to me is like, when you do something repeatedly over time, you start to see patterns. Yeah, right. And so in, in what we do for a living, right, you start to see patterns of behaviors patterns of this same sort of issues arise. Yeah, absurd dealing with and so that's where a coach can really, you know, share experience.

Nico Johnson  9:04  
Yeah, I concur in that. I can't even I can't put into two qualification terms, the number of times that either from a podcast episode where I've off, off, sort of offline gotten to go deep with a founder, or in another coaching session, I've been able to bring examples experiences from where I've seen something that looked similar it if you think about it, the way we used to all go to the eye at least go to barber shop and I'd sit waiting for a haircut. Look through the magazine right? At all the different examples of hairstyles. Well, the person sitting in the in the in the barber position, right? Not the barber chair, but the person the stylist doesn't have to look at that magazine. They've seen 1000s of heads. They know they even they even can remember if you come in frequently enough exactly the con To receive your hair and and what it is that you are looking for. And if you come to them and say what's going to look good on me, they can give you advice. But in the same way this came to me when you were talking about that, and I didn't know, I didn't, I didn't I didn't imagine we'd spend three or four minutes on this. But I think this is really important because one of the questions that we may want to wrap with at the end of this conversation is how do I actually select a coach if I if I want to go down this path? And for me, it's a very deep individual, personal choice in the same way. Some people go to Supercuts because they don't care. Yep. Right? I go to a place called rocks, barbershop, and rocks here in Durham is the place for beards and beard trims and so much so that the logo is a man's beard, right? There's another place called Garin called Pedro's that their their tagline is guaranteed shorter hair. Right? Well, I don't need, I don't need shorter hair, I want good looking hair. So I trust the folks that rocks and I pay more for to probably upgrade premium, we'll just say that. So there's, there is a personal selection process that is hard to paint in broad strokes. But what is easier to paint in broad strokes, strokes are the fundamentals of how businesses work. And so what, what brought this conversation up for you and I is that I get a lot of folks in the interview process who when they, when I asked them, you know, were there any fundamental building blocks or more books that you refer to traction, and rocket fuel over and over come up. And those if you're not familiar, as a listener? Are the books written by Gina Whitman that are part of an entire canon of books around what they've dubbed Eos, or the entrepreneur operating system? Maria, you have been an implementer for five plus years as an as an EOS certified. Coach, can you talk about the various frameworks and the value to the entrepreneur that exist that coaches often lean on, like being an EOS implementer to help an entrepreneur that has a great idea, probably a growing business, and they're trying to figure out how to corral the work or the objectives or some piece of the business just feels off and they're looking for support? Can you just kind of take us into that place where EOS and, and other frameworks exist? Sure.

Speaker 1  12:28  
But you need to clarify Miko, because I'm not an ARS. implementer current okay. Yeah, I've not I left the EOS implementer. Community in gosh, I think it was 2020. So Oh, wow. Yeah, I

Nico Johnson  12:46  
didn't realize that far back. Yeah. So

Speaker 1  12:48  
it's been a number of years that I've been. And then I joined another group. But now I'm delightfully independent, other than I do have a peer group of around a dozen other women who do similar work to an idea. So I think the reason that traction and rocket fuel and the whole EOS concept has been so powerful, is because they really nail the fundamentals, what it takes to run a great business, right, so they talk about meeting structures, they talk about accountability, they talk about KPIs and vision and they do it in a way. You know, they talked about six key components. Well, that's really simple. Right? And everybody concerned to wrap their heads around that. And it's it's been distilled. I mean, I think Gina Whitman is a genius, because basically what he did was he distilled, you know, 1000s, maybe of, of business books, right? There's tons of them out there son's other operating systems out there. But he distilled it down to what was really fundamental, like the gotta haves, the necessary like, if you're gonna run a great business, you got to have these things. You know, the reason that I'm no longer an ARS implementer is because it's a very, it's very structured, it's very specific, how it runs, what I found, with the clients that I work with, who I think we probably share a lot of the similar type of clients, many of them outright resisted being put into a box, right. And so they wanted to name their meetings, different things they wanted to, they just they wanted to have their own custom flavor of an operating system. There are a ton of them out there, right they're scaling up there's great game of business has a basically a type of operating system. There's even a there's there's So many, right. But the fundamental concept that you have to have, you know, what I tell people is you just take your phone has an operating system that operates in the background, your business needs to have that too. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  15:16  
because it tells insurance, as I say, my operations manager ensures the trains run on time, right. But something's got to someone has to something, some system has to come up with that schedule with the algorithm with the protocols, the processes by which everyone else can make decisions. Everybody,

Speaker 1  15:34  
it's it's a framework we need is like, you can think of it as the scaffolding of your organization, right, that we can, we can all operate together.

Nico Johnson  15:48  
I would encourage folks to read books like traction, and rocket fuel and scaling up by Vern Harnish. We've recommended all those numerous times here on the podcast, I have actually found a number of entrepreneurs who can read those books and just go to work. They're, they're architects and visionaries to use some US terms. But why then do so many folks fall in the category of? Well, I've read the book, and I'm still not doing and I'm not creating the meetings and how can how can I coach like yourself? Help them get get through that process? Is it more than just accountability? Are there? You know, Is there specific clarity that needs to be found beyond just what the book can teach? Absolutely.

Speaker 1  16:35  
I mean, what's coming to me Nico's going back to your beard reference, right, I can watch a YouTube video, or read a book on how to have a great beard, it doesn't mean that I can actually do it. I need someone to teach me I need someone to guide me along. And help me. Because there there are nuances right now and each. Which bring it back to business. Every business is unique. Yeah, right. So and I really don't believe that there is I did believe this for quite some time. Again, I don't believe there's a one size fits all approach. And I used to be like, really? No, you have to run your meetings in exactly this way. Oh, yeah. And it's very prescriptive. Yeah, maybe you need a way to run meetings, because your meetings are terrible right now. And so we can talk about that. But maybe your meetings are doing just fine. And you need to bring in some other elements. Maybe it's how what you're talking about in those meetings. For example, I read something recently, I wish I can remember what it where it came from. But there was talking about like the, the landscape, right, so you need to understand the land east, each individual business has its own landscape that it's operating in. Yeah, and particularly like within the solar industry, there is like a constant in the solar industry as policy change. And so someone who understands that landscape and understands the implications of we're going to need to adjust our plan as we go. And we need to be very realistic about Yes, we can have a 10 year vision, and also recognize that something outside anything that we've imagined yet could come in and change the game for us. Now being able to maintain that flexibility, and again, particularly in the solar industry, I think is so important. And

Nico Johnson  18:55  
having an outside agent, so to speak, does it helps to get that the the unbiased, objective viewpoint? Yeah, I find that a lot of folks I work with, they prefer, and it's a part of our agreements that I'm not going to agree with them. Or they actually, in many ways hope that I don't agree with them, that I can be a voice of reason. And in some cases I happen. And I'm certain that you have as well, you know, there's there are some real fundamental building blocks that a lot of us as entrepreneurs forego in the early stages. I'm really impressed. In fact, when I see a business that is one or two years old, and really has already written down their vision and their values, and they've tried to define the culture of the business before they have three, four or five, even 10 employees write the importance of the core concept of core values. I'd like to explore with you because I find often when a business is growing faster than they are able to Manage, it can come down to a few things and core values is one of them. In terms of the stumbling blocks, can you help unpack a bit? How core values can be a great building block? How to guide a founder through the process of establishing those core values? And, and then how they can be a tool for behavior, regulation and agreements inside the company? Yeah,

Speaker 1  20:25  
absolutely. Thank you for asking about that. It's probably my favorite topic. Because I think that core values are often misunderstood, right. And they're often there's a, there's a couple of things that when I, when I work with clients, I asked them to think of behaviors that they want to, that they want to see more of in the organization. And I always have them make core values that you see core values on on the wall integrity, like invariably, I'll walk into a client, and they'll have things, you know, integrity, trust, safety, you know, everything, which are all things that are important and things that we value. But I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with that. Always guide clients to how to activate their core values and make sure that they have verbs. Right. So seek solutions, for example, as opposed to collaboration is an example. And once you have these fundamental, the Hey, behavior based core values and place, then it makes the relationships inside the organization go much smoother. Because we all know what's expected of us in terms of how we're going to just what we're going to do, what we do is very important, but the thing that keeps companies from reaching their full potential, I believe, is not we guys change what we do. It's how we're being together, and how we are how we operate as a team, and how we solve problems together. That really makes a difference. And core values are guideposts. Right. So we seek solutions as an example, right? When, when that's one of that's STMS first core value. Yeah. And when we hire someone, when we ask questions around, tell me about a time when you ran into, you know, an issue and you had to solve a problem you didn't there wasn't an SOP for it? What did you do? And so we ask behavior based questions. And then, you know, the other thing is when things go sideways a little bit as they sometimes can, with people

Nico Johnson  22:55  
can lean back on those core values. Yeah, I had a great example of that, with a client who had gotten serious finally about their core values. And the entire team, especially the leadership team had agreed upon them. And they had a foreman in the field, a young guy who had been given a lot of responsibility and trust. And they really wanted to keep him on board. But the CEO was having a hard time giving him critical feedback about the behavior, how he was being as a leader in the field, to the other young folks in the crew. And I said, Well, I understand that you've got this core value that they're not aligned with, and that that core values and agreement on the team. And he took a step back, and he said, Whoa, actually, you're right. This isn't me personally judging this guy. It is us collectively looking at the objective reality that he's not in alignment with a core value we've all said that we're going to adhere to right. And the freedom that gave him as the founder and CEO, and that gives his operators to be able to manage expectations on the team is tremendous. And I think that that's a it's a it's a missed opportunity for most companies that dismiss values and core values as kind of intangible. Yeah, sort of things that people do when they're wasting time not doing real business. It's

Speaker 1  24:28  
the fluffy stuff, right? Yeah. It actually I would argue that clearly articulated core values and a clearly articulated very simple purpose. Yeah, are the two things that every business needs to have from from day one, I mean, they can they can evolve over time. Sem for years had innovate for impact was our eye We, we, our core values spell the word shine, which is kind of cutesy and whatever. But I tell you, it helps people remember it does, it really does, but I was innovate for impact. And at one of our quarterly or annual planning sessions, one of our team members said, you know, I don't think this suits us anymore. And so we ended up changing to invest in the greater good, which has a lot of different connotations. But one of them is just like, you're saying, Nico, what this team lead, was saying he needed was a way to have a conversation with a team member who wasn't like collaborating and seeking solutions. It was really more about me over we, he needed a way to talk about that. And the rest of the the guy that we caught the guidance team at SCM, the rest of our team agreed. And so it changed that they're not, you know, and I always tell my clients, this, it's not their core, to who you are, and their agreements about behaviors, yeah, of how you're going to be together, as the business evolves, maybe something's missing, maybe you need to change it like you should always revisit them and make sure again, that that alignment, total, that's how we want to be still being articulated.

Nico Johnson  26:33  
Yeah. And I appreciate the you also gave the example a few moments ago, of how to integrate core values into behavior based questions that allow you to filter for the right people at the beginning of the process, arguably, the most important part of building a business is the hiring and getting that team aligned around those core values, as you rightly said, around those agreements, so that someone can self select that they are not willing to line up for those agreements. But also your team knows how to vote, to give a fair judgement around whether or not a potential candidate seems like a good cultural fit. And you have to have that barometer, you have to have that yardstick, so to speak of the culture. And the core values helped to establish that you and I talked a bit about the different frameworks, one of the ones that I know you, you appreciate, even if it's not, sort of at every turn, all 15 of them, you have integrated the 15 commitments, and I sort of look at that, whereas EOS is tactical sort of meetings and KPIs 15 commitments sort of helps to to define certain behavioral and cultural norms that that accompany can align around. And one of those that's a core piece of it is this concept of the Drama Triangle. So I'd like for you to help in the in the waning moments of our conversation here, I'd love for you to help explain the process of creating a drama free workplace.

Speaker 1  28:03  
Well, first, you get you get this agreement set first, you know, someone core values. Yeah, what did what did I hear what's unclear expectations are a down payment for future resentment. Oh, my God, that's good. So that's good. So that's, that's my pitch for clear core values. You know, the 15 commitments is really ultimately about creating a drama free workplace, I see those things as synonymous, because it's about like, moving from victim hero bully, that Hartman's Drama Triangle. He was a psychologist in the 60s, Emily, who worked with dysfunctional relationships. And he found people were playing these three roles, one of these three roles, and sometimes all of them within the same interaction. We have a whole new whole thing about that. But then there's a then there's the inverse of it, which is a shift, and 15 commandments does the best job that I've ever seen articulating this. There's a line and you shift from being victim hero bully, to being challenged your coach and kukri. Well, they say creator, I referred him co creator, co creator, because we like that's where, as an organization, that's where we want to be. We want to challenge each other, we want to coach and lead and help each other to grow, so that we can co create the future and the results that we agree on that we want to create. And, again, just this concept of if people can get that there is a shift from victim and it's really from victim To cocreator, that's the fundamental shift, right? Things are happening to me and to us. And, you know, the whole Solar coaster thing. Don't get me started on that. But I've tried to ban it. Because I think it's victim language. It's like, we're we're at any rate, I won't go too deep into that. But instead, like, what, what does it look like when we're powerful co creators, it's one of the reason I really appreciate the language that you use. As I got a little, you know, solar warrior still makes me a little uncomfortable. But that's my own stuff. But it is about like, we're we're co creating this this transition and this feature. Yeah. And that is that's above the line language.

Nico Johnson  30:50  
Yeah, you're not alone. By the way, I've been told. I appreciate that. You acknowledge that. That's something that you are that that is an internal conflict for you the solar warrior concept, because it is something that I've been, I've had only only women honestly have said that they, they struggle with it. And I'm, I'm okay with it. Because I have, you know, in creating a brand, part of creating a community or a tribe, which I have to be sensitive around to certainly in, in the way that it is described, is giving a common vernacular. And there's a ton of folks that come up to me, and they'll say, I'm a solar warrior, man, I love it. And they love the moniker. So

Speaker 1  31:33  
well, I'll just say, my number one core value personally, and for my estate curious, and for my business as well, like things a coach that's required, we have to stay curious. I'm really curious about my response to it. And maybe we maybe that's maybe I do need to have more of a warrior mentality. So I'll, I'll take that away from this conversation. And

Nico Johnson  31:58  
yeah, yeah. I think I've never tried to enunciate it. But I believe that the concept around Soler warrior for me is that a warrior is courageous. And I think that we don't appreciate that, in context of history, a warrior routinely left home not never knowing if they would come back.

Speaker 1  32:26  
Absolutely. And I think those of us who have been around this industry for a while, you know, for me, it was 2001. I've certainly had to, on multiple occasions, dig down to connect with that inner warrior. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  32:48  
Yeah. I mean, we really are in a fight for the for for what is truth, we're going to fight for, how do we preserve the kind of planet that we want to pass on to our children, and really, to their children's children? And how do we feel that we are contributing to the legacy either up destroying or preserving that planet. And I do think that there are those who sit on the sidelines, and they believe they're neither, they're neither destroying or preserving, and they're okay with that. Most of the people I know, in the solar industry, are not here, because they see huge dollar signs, there are a lot of those, but it's because they believe that this is one of the key levers that can unlock our ability to reduce the our impact on on the environment. And, you know, getting back to the framework of the Drama Triangle, you know, I would encourage folks to explore it, I'll link to the 15 commitments, and also a nice Forbes article around how to transform your relationships through understanding drama, drama triangle, because the core of not just building out these core values, but of implementing something like Eos, or traction or sorry, or scaling up or any Rockefeller habits, like really picking a with a thing that gives you a framework. It is to get clear, to your point on what are those expectations? How do I should there's alignment in our in my organization, such that as the owner, I can focus on the things that only I can accomplish, and I can trust my team, to be going. Going all out on the things that we agree are important without me feeling like I needed to micromanage and, you know, just losing sleep over it. And knowing that the business can operate, ideally, if you want to be a business owner, without you. Right, yeah. One last question before we wrap, assuming someone has had a sense of of a spark today that I know they're asking the question, well, how how do I go about picking a coach? Do you have a few words of wisdom there?

Speaker 1  34:59  
I would say that core values fit is relevant there as well. Right? And like the making sure like the right coach for your business is somebody who number one you trust and resonate with. And you want to make sure that they do have a process that they follow whether it's one of the, you know, ones that you've named, or whether they have their own process like I do, right. They're not just winging it when when they come in, in this particular, like, if they're answering this call to implement to create their own operating system within their ration. Yeah. And then it's really important that you trust the person, and that you get along with them, and that you believe that they can help you. Yeah. And also, it's just as important for the coach to want to do the work with Yeah, I'm like, you just have to, I don't know why this works coming to me, but you got to fog with them. You know, it's true. I'm not it's truly not for everybody. Nico, I don't know about it. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  36:25  
Ya know, there are people who want someone to be along the path with them. And there are others who want a drill sergeant. And there's nothing wrong with either of those two, I tell people, if you want to run a 5k, you probably don't need a coach, if you want to win the 5k, you absolutely need a coach, if you want to run a Tough Mudder you probably don't need a coach, if you want to set a PR in your next Tough Mudder you probably need a coach. So it's a question of aspiration, you know, and where you seek to gain advantage and improve on yourself and your business and how how you surround yourself with the right tools matters in terms of how long it takes. And whether or not you can get there is not usually a question for most entrepreneurs, it's how long will it take? And how much pain will I endure?

Speaker 1  37:20  
That's the I think the last thing is like, man, sometimes you just need help to get off the struggle bus, right? Yes, we as entrepreneurs, like that's part of the adrenaline that we get. But it doesn't have to be as painful. Maria,

Nico Johnson  37:38  
I'm grateful for folks like you who package the business experience of two decades into a consulting practice in a way that is heart led, and that allows entrepreneurs to tap into that knowledge without having to go through the experience painfully themselves and, and feel like they're on an island, which is the most common retort of most of most successful entrepreneurs that it's lonely at the top, proverbially speaking. So thank you for being courageous to, to do this. Obviously, you've got a business of your own that you guys are running. And, and you could be doing any number of things. And speaking for any number of stages, appreciate you taking the time to come to SunCast to help share this message. If folks are so inclined, how can they get to know you better? How can I connect with you?

Nico Johnson  39:07  
Thank you. The gratitude is mutual. And I hope that folks will take seriously the deep inner work. I think that we're in a cultural revolution right now, where entrepreneurs realize that the grinding out mentality doesn't lead to a fulfilling life. For most, it certainly does for some, and the rest of us got to figure out, okay, it's actually a marathon. How am I going to survive this marathon? I'm not going to exit in two years or five out, how do I turn this into something that I never look for an exit because I'm so fulfilled in my work and I see that you help entrepreneurs answer that question. So thank you for spending time with us and thank you for tuning in, either on YouTube or on the podcast. I hope that you will take this information to heart that you will come heard it from knowledge into wisdom. And the only way to do that is through application. So if you if you need help with that, please reach out to Maria or myself. There are numerous ways that you can accomplish that. And certainly link in the description to how you can reach either of us and I, I, I want it to be known that I am not asking you to come be my coaching client and neither is Maria, we're asking you to consider that there is value in the in having someone as a support.
