Speaker 1  0:00  
You know, when you're thinking about naming a solar company, now we're a big fan of the name summit energy kind of being the peak of power as a tagline. But similar to an iceberg, as we've grown the organization, we've gone through our journey, the name has developed much more meaning and much more purpose behind us. And one thing I'm so grateful for is all the trials and all the peaks and the valleys through our entrepreneur journey, the last seven half years that have created know the concept of somebody, it's about the journey, it's about the climb, it's not the destination,

Speaker 2  0:25  
no here in the United States, all the infrastructure and just the amazing country that we have, let's keep building it. Let's believe in what we can do as a country and as a nation, and what we can do and empower the rest of the world. And let's leave a place to where our kids and their kids look back at our generation. They're like, Oh, we're grateful that they prioritize these things and pushed hard on these things, because they were important to leave the world in a better spot for us when we were here, right, and then hopefully, they can continue on that legacy.

Nico Johnson  0:56  
Welcome back to SunCast. It is our job to guide you on your journey as you level up in your professional career in clean energy. And I hope that while you invest the only non renewable resource you've got, which is your time, you come away with tactical practical advice you can integrate as you build into your culture, your career, your company, greatness in every aspect. SunCast is here to try to help you do that through the lens of the leaders of the solar and the broader clean energy industry. And a few months ago, I had the chance through our friends at Bodie and unifrac. To meet Eric Israel son, who we'll spend some time with. Today, Eric and his co founder Dallin mall, are the leaders of a company called summit energy. They are the protagonists in a story that is much greater than just the two of them. Today, we'll dig into the culture they've built around Summit, we'll talk about some of the iconography, and the way that they integrate the real, thoughtful, intentional methodology for building a company, from books from mentors, and from really hard life lessons. I hope that you stick around all the way to the end, I promise that you won't regret it. And if you like stories, just like this clean energy leaders on the frontlines of the energy transition, you're in the right place, I hope that you'll subscribe if you're new to the channel. And I hope that you will check out some of the other nearly 700 conversations that we've hosted here on SunCast. But for now, let's get ready to tune up your skills solo warrior, as we tune into another powerful conversation here on SunCast. I want to kick off the way I usually have been had become accustomed to I'm a quote, hoarder. And I know that you guys are too. So I wanted to invite you each to share a quote, that's inspiring. And you probably have a handful in the top of mine. But I remember that you shared a quote in a live broadcast that really stuck out to me, Eric, and it was by John Quincy Adams on defining leadership, because you start with that one.

Speaker 2  3:00  
Sure. I had another one in mind. This thought is one. Another one I shared in the podcast is, you know, the Tony Robbins success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure, which we could speak more to that one. But here John Quincy Adams, and I might lose a couple other words without reading it off the page. But If your actions inspire others to do more, be more become more than you are a leader by John Quincy Adams said I might have mixed up a couple of words, but I think I got the essence of the quote. But we love that because that's inspired us we've had that quote, kind of a top of mind and, and kind of weaved throughout the organization from the early days. Yeah, because we look at every individual person that joins our team, as a leader. It doesn't matter if you have a title leadership is not a title, leadership is influence. And every person that walks on the planet has the ability to influence another person. And so those are just, that's why that quote has been so inspirational to us because it allows us to kind of flip the mindset of seeking to bless not to impress, what am I giving not what am I giving? Or sorry, what am I giving not? What am I getting? Right? It allows us to kind of just take the simple, reframing things in our mind and to actually view people as people as we should. And I think all of us agree with that concept. Yeah. But in the hustle and bustle of life, and busyness and the fast paced society that we live in, sometimes, I think most people are good people, but sometimes inadvertently, we tend to just treat people by objects. I mean, you look at a big city. We're here in Boston, right? You look at a big city. If I'm commuting into Boston today, how many hundreds or 1000s of people my age As passed by, right so, by nature, it's it's just hard to look at every person and see a person. But the more intentional we are about that. We bring out the best in each other because it's, it's, it's when we look at each other as people of value and as people that we all rise together, we're all the whole human family is in life's journey together, right? And if we're not being intentional to remind ourselves of that, we lose sight of it. And we tend to just see other people as objects, maybe inadvertently, but that's when we start losing what fulfills us because really what fulfills people is other people Yeah,

Nico Johnson  5:39  
that's really beautifully said. I'm going to share one and then down on invite you to share one. This one stands out to me, particularly given the conversation that we were having, before we press record here, the human spirit is to grow strong by conflict that's by William Ellery Channing. credible, yeah, powerful, I thought that entrepreneurship, despite all the books that suggest that it's, it's a lonely path, that it's difficult, arduous and that every entrepreneur that makes it a 10 year overnight success, thought somehow my journey would be different. Right. And I'm sure many listening and watching feel that same way. So I hope that we can talk about not just the peaks of the mountain, in your journey, but the valleys as well.

Speaker 1  6:31  
On the valleys where you're gathering the resources, you recharge, you get ready, and then you go back to the next peak, and then you go back to the valley recharge, to get to the bigger peak in the higher peaks. You know, when you're thinking about naming a solar company, and I remember we're starting solid is what do you want to name our company. And now we're a big fan of the name, summit energy kind of being the peak of power was just a tagline. But similar to an iceberg, as we've grown the organization, we've gone through our journey, the name has developed much more meaning and much more purpose behind us. And when you're trying to name a company, it's something clever and marketable, and things like that. But one thing I'm so grateful for is all the trials and all the peaks and the valleys through our entrepreneur during the last seven half years that have created, you know, the concept of somebody, it's about the journey, it's about the climb, it's not the destination. Yeah. And it's about becoming similar to yours. And you know, the call of leadership is, you know, one of our favorite quotes me and Eric, we nerd out on quotes all the time. But success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure. And I've been able to see some people who have been very successful without much fulfillment. And people who maybe haven't seen so much monetary or business success, but extreme, they were extremely fulfilled, and much happier than those people that had every material thing in the world they could want and weren't happy. And we're just dissatisfied in searching for that. Yeah. So we're grateful, you know, that we've gone through enough things, enough trials and errors that we can realize that and try to embody that into our team and our culture, and just be thankful for the ups and the downs, because they all lead to becoming a better person, and you learn more from the trials, and you do from the successes for those and it's made me a very humble leader. And you know, leadership's calling you can choose whether to answer it or not. leadership's never forced upon anyone a lot of time. You're called sometimes you're ready. Sometimes you're not. Yeah, um, but when that calling comes, and you pick up the phone and said, I'm gonna give this a shot, and then be a good leader, you take that stewardship a lot more serious than if you just think, well, I have to do this, it's, I get to do this. And it's a calling that you chose to answer.

Nico Johnson  8:29  
As you all, think about the purpose, the meaning that brings fulfillment in some energy, without directly talking about your company, if you're in a conversation out in public, how do you describe the problem that some energy is trying to solve?

Speaker 2  8:45  
Normally? What I tell people, when when people ask, who is some I said, we're a people company that does solar, not the other way around. So if we really want to dive deep, deep into the problem that we're trying to solve, it's just to help people see value in themselves. Because what we deeply believe and you know, our mission statements might sound very broad, but it's we empower people to elevate tomorrow. So and as we dive deeper into that iceberg, you know, below the surface of, of the depth of that is, you know, we truly believe that each person walking on the planet has seeds of greatness within them. Yeah. And as leadership, you know, leadership is not a license to do less, it's a responsibility to do more. And as leaders, I think one of the best frameworks to maybe view leadership is in the lens of a gardener. The power in of each person, the power to grow is in the seat itself. It's not in the gardener. Thank you. But what does the gardener do? He creates the environment and the nourishment for the sea to flourish and reach its full potential. So as leaders, that's what our job is. We're not. We're not responsible for any other individuals. So access that power was in their own seed. But we can help that environment that helps that seed flourish. And so those are really what have inspired us to start a company in the first place. And why solar? Well, today in today's economic environment, our world needs to transition to cleaner energy. Yeah, right. And we all need that the human, the human, family on planet Earth, the plants, the animals, we all just we need to get energy from cleaner sources. And we've learned that and I think people understand that. So we've just identified sola as, if not the best one of the best vehicles for us today, to accomplish the things that really matter to us. And we built a business around those philosophies, and, and we've been hyper intentional to make sure that all of that is ingrained into what we do on a day to day basis. Right. So getting another customer, another homeowner, solar, it's not just oh, great, we made more money. No, we have to empower another family, like they're gonna save 10s of 1000s of dollars by converting to solar versus money that they would have spent in extra utility bills, what can that family now do with that money, or that individual or that business, right, they can invest it back into their kids, college funds, or whatever else they do with it, they can spend it on experiences, rather than having it go out. So we do our best in all of our business philosophy or business strategies to make sure that people are at the center of everything. Yeah. And that it's, you know, it all starts with our own people internally, we have to create that and culture, that culture that sees people and serves people and adds value to people. Yeah. But ultimately, it extends to our customers at the end of the line. And that's kind of our that's our colon culminating experience is when we've been able to create a wow experience, not only through the products and the offerings and the savings, but hopefully that person just felt seen and felt valued. And that's an additional way, we don't make money on that. And he maybe they send us more referrals and things. And we do right but, but ultimately, we delivered value to them, hopefully just helping them seen be seen as a person. And they felt like we treated their home like our own. So in those ways, we're able to add value to people that are maybe less easy to measure. But that's important, right? When we get to the end of our lives. And this is something that's enabled me in Dallas to power through the ups and the downs and the peaks and the valleys as we agree on these important things. And so one thing we both agree on is neither of us want to get to the end of life's journey, and look back and wish we would have lost sight on what's really important. And that's why we've taken the steps from the beginning days of the of the business journey, to make sure that those are weaved right into the foundation of what our company is because that's what's important to us. I mean, we don't know where this will go when we look out 10 or 20 or 30 years down the road. But we will both be able to look back and say we focused on what we truly valued and what was truly important to us. And we're okay with living with that. Whatever comes with that we're okay with it because we didn't lose sight of what's really important to us.

Speaker 1  13:22  
Yeah, and I? That's a great question. And I think even today in society is just seeing people's people. You know, I think business profits and revenue are not an evil thing. Yeah, you know, that they can lead to good things and change and everything like that. But as we look at people, and we look at the potential that they could become, and we see ourselves as coaches or gardeners, and we always say some, it's about the journey, it's about the climb, it's about becoming, it's not about the destination, or you're not just imagining one day gonna show up and change someone is there's gonna be incremental steps, and you're gonna climb a couple of hills and fall back down and then climb up a little bit higher. And how do we help people along that journey and breathe belief in themselves that I am capable, I am strong, I can do hard things. And some people just need that little bit of belief. You know, and we always say a good leader is a dealer and hope. And it's something I've navigated, you know, we grow up and there's command leadership, but how do you be a dealer of hope to your team through hard times and things like that, you can be straightforward with someone but they'll lead them to believe that there's better things ahead and it's amazing to watch people it's those layers break down where they've been beaten down so much by society and life, that they're hoping their eyes start opening up as well. I'm a person of value and there's so much I can do and we're so purpose driven when I got into solar at I saw it as an opportunity to make good money and you know, that was a part of the equation but I love that I could sit down with the family. It didn't cost them anything. You know, this is gas This is groceries. This is literally baseball trips. This is a trip to Disneyland it's like an all the things that people become through those savings. If they reinvest that money, they now can go buy a book. They didn't have a power bill, they you know, they can afford to go to dinner with their family, build relationships. Like, the important thing is that we do, it's everything behind what we do is the important things, you know, the savings is just the tip of the iceberg. Everything that unfolds underneath that is so incredible. And we're just grateful to be a partner of that, a part of that and the facilitator of that. And then that trickles down to our teams. And then the belief that they have that they're changing the world. And people work so much higher, harder when they have a purpose, and they just do for money or, you know, praise or things like that. But if it's purpose driven, when I was knocking doors, I would tell myself down there, there's a film out there who need savings, it wasn't I need to make more, I need to have better numbers. And it's funny because my battery go from being drained to completely filled up if one of the reasons I was knocking doors and tell people about solar was less about me, and it was more about them. And then if I could give them a $500 referral fee, and now they can, you know, pay for their kids to get a football equipment or they want to play hockey, so we could go on and on for this, Nick, I don't want to take up too much. You're not, you're so passionate. We love it so much. You know, we one day, we hope, you know, we could be a case study for all businesses that that revenue is a byproduct of doing things, right and treating people as people and being a purpose driven organization. Yeah,

Speaker 2  16:05  
it's been an amazing journey. I mean, a lot of discomfort, a lot of growth, a lot of peaks, a lot of valleys. But it's rewarding, you know, and when, when you can align your day to day activities, what with what you feel deep down resonates with with your soul, and what you believe your purpose for being here is, it doesn't feel like work anymore. And you can push through the hard times, because it's not work, you're living your purpose, and you're living your calling, right. So the more we can help all of our people on their team feel that meaning and feel that purpose. And they're part of this journey as well. That's where we get the real power. Me and Donald look at each other and where you know where our business is at today. And it's like, it's awesome, but neither of us look at each other and think that it was due to us. It's we we look around, and we just see we yeah, we don't see me or me. I mean, obviously there's we do look at individuals and the importance of the me, but it's it's are we collectively that that have gotten the journey to where it's at today? And that's going to keep it going and and that's going to broaden our impact. Yeah,

Speaker 1  17:23  
I always tell people, you know, a brand is amazing, but it's only as good as the people behind it. Yeah. You know, so some of them are there's some of the energy, which is the brand and the name. But what's important is, you know, Chris Lawson, He's our director of marketing, how he says that your brand is a promise Yeah, to the consumer. So when people think so what energy what promises being delivered to the consumer from that brand? And so I want to be honest, sincere contractor, and you know, nega is your listeners probably has listened to got to know you. I mean, you have a strong purpose behind what you do with these podcasts. You're, you're trying to inspire the future leaders or help people that are stuck in certain parts of their lives or business of how do I get over this hurdle? Or how do I climb this next mountain they've never done before. And I you know, I love that what you do, and I've, as I've talked with you very passionate about what you do and why you do it. And that's inspiring to me, and you've charged my battery, just from the short time that we've got to spend with each other. And you can even take a second I know I'm kind of kind of reverse this a little bit. But that mean tells you I mean, like what is your why why you do these podcasts you've developed in business in life, what are some of your why's that as your listeners get to know you that can inspire them. And this would be a good opportunity to aspire myself and Eric, because I love to hear people's stories. Everyone has an amazing story. And I'm so passionate when I get to hear that and grateful because it inspires me and I can internalize that and in what ways can I help them?

Nico Johnson  18:36  
Thank you. I'm so glad to be on the summit podcast today. This is really truly an honor to join you guys on on on your journey. I I really think that you you guys are missing an opportunity by not having a podcast where you can capture more of the essence of what it is that you believe I've learned in the last 10 minutes or reinforced more about leadership then I would argue the last 10 episodes I've recorded. And it's not to in any way denigrate those other interviews, but the focus that you all have that's so intentional around cultivating the right culture. And and I as well in a dealer in hopium.

Speaker 2  19:23  
Love it. I've never trademark that we're gonna take that page out of your book. That's good.

Nico Johnson  19:31  
That's good. So Dallin I accept that. That invitation. Thank you for turning the turning the table here. The I want to bridge off of something that Eric said. And that is you are planting the seed and a farmer. So one of the things that you all do incredibly well it was obvious from the minute we did our first pre call getting ready for our live broadcast with you all with Eric earlier in the year. It is tying the message to story. Because people for centuries have lived on stories, right? It's what ties us together. Yeah. However, solar as a industry is a trade. Right, just the the way the same that plumbing and roofing and electricals trade. I mean, we've had to mature that trade to build respect and earn trust with homeowners that we're not trying to ruin their rooftop and not trying to take away the roofers business. We're not trying to, you know, disrupt the electrical industry or even the utility industry. And there's a lot of, there's a lot of us versus them mentality in what we call the energy transition. And I started my solar company in 2006. In California, where not only was I incredibly fortunate to be there, kind of like you were incredibly fortunate to be in Utah, the moment that you were there, get into a little bit of backstory there that I recognized that homeowners were over the course of the last 10 years being propositioned, right, they weren't being invited into a journey. They're being propositioned on low finance rates and aggressive sales tactics and, and the industry was starting to develop a culture and the perception that really didn't belie the type of honest growth that we saw. And, and I realized that one of the reasons is, there was a lack of storytelling at a higher level from the brands like next tracker and sungrow and Shireen on the brands that we've come to respect, who talked about the work that they do, and the meaning of the product they're creating. But I think more so, in the trades at the companies like summit, the ability to convey the message of how you're building, an organization that could sell anything from pencils, and paper to promise is, it is about harnessing the power of the collective way. Right. And if homeowners think that it's about us, both propositioning and trying to take advantage of not first their rooftops, then their family farms, then the large swaths of land that should be dedicated to food and farming. And they miss the opportunity to empower growth in their community, where if it's not in your community, it's gonna be in some other community. But if we miss the opportunity to actually engage the communities in this, in this cultural dialogue about how we need to change the way we create electricity. And I think for my career and message, it will eventually evolve as well into water as a scarce resource where electricity is an abundant resource, we're creating the capacity for an abundant ever expanding resource and electricity. And we have an increasingly constrained resource and water. I saw that there's, there's no one out there that is taking taking the mic taking the mantle and saying they will help broadcast that message in a clear way. And at at SunCast, when I created the podcast, it was just about how do I find people like you all, and share not just the vision and the story of who they are, but the tactical ways that they've achieved? what some would call success, credible. And if I could hold them up an example to say, here's someone if you're in the wilderness that you can follow, but also show hey, here's some of the ways that they in the wilderness wish they had a guidepost. Right, because they turn left on they should have turned right. Yeah. So a few people talk about the failures. And I was having a conversation yesterday with a friend and I said, you know, one of the one of the key elements to successful communication in any industry is calling a spade a spade. In our industry, right now, we have an opportunity to be to, to be on the nose about things in the solar industry that are problems that need to be resolved, rather than letting the collective they that don't want solar or any other type of clean or renewable energy to succeed. Be a they want it to look like it's a pariah like we're out to steal homeowners money or out to steal municipalities or governments handouts. Right? You know, the way we've had trends transacted with with financing and dealer fees, in many cases is useless to the homeowner and I'm not the first to call our industry out on that. The way that we we lambaste the fossil fuel in the mining industry for effectively strip mining and tearing off the tops of our mountain. and ruining communities. But we hide behind the veil of climate action to avoid the appearance of the same exact activity where we're stripping 1000s of acres of resource. And we're grading the top three feet of soil, so that we can put perfectly straight trackers out there without regard for what's going to happen in 25 years when we take that asset away, and we want to repurpose that land for something else. And it's been completely depleted of its of its of its next life usefulness, right. So many, so many elements of the way we treat our natural resources like trees, and dirt. That if we're honest with our stakeholders, that these are actually the downsides, the impacts that we have, and we're trying to mitigate how to do that, because we had to come up with financing tools that would help folks treat this like a vehicle or an H vac system, or else we wouldn't have accelerated at the at the inflection point that we did in around 2013 2015. Right. So my purpose and mission with SunCast is to help folks realize that this is the greatest opportunity in transforming the way we collectively use and view electricity as a transformative property itself in our in our culture in our lives. And that it's also a great resource financially, for people who are asking for one main economic value from all their, all of our policymakers. And that is jobs, how do we bring jobs back home? Right, I mean, we could go deep into the conversation politically and culturally about, you know, left or right of the aisle, who is better advocate for jobs and, and energy broadly. But someone has to talk about how we lead through this transition, right? I'm gonna come back to the point about the seed, I am a part of a of a community in Durham, where we meet on a farm, and we grow food. And, and the pastor of that community says, often he says, you know, a farmer doesn't grow food grows soil. Beyond planting that seed, the only thing the farmer can do is ensure that the soil has nutrients now, yep, that the soil is tilt, that there's no weeds in the soil, that the seeds are plentiful, and they're planted in the right place now that they receive water can't do anything to ensure that that seed germinates, that it grows to its full potential. We can only plant water and hope foster

Speaker 2  27:45  
the conditions. Yeah. Yeah. I love that it's powerful. And when just as hearing you talk, and you think about that, like, it's so easy to just walk through every day and pass by, literally, if you think of a seed, it's like a miracle in the size of a seed. And it happens all around us. Yeah. So I love that.

Speaker 1  28:08  
When I look to that, it's not instant. You know, how much time does it take to cohort soil, you don't just go and pour water and you know, some chemicals on that. And then boom, you're done it, it's very patient, that constant days training, whether you're protecting it, you know, probably in the right time and things like that. And, you know, leadership is patients and helping something go through which journey? Yeah, you don't just plant the seed, then you're done as how often are you going back to revisit that seed and pull the weeds out and check on it. And the seed was site, how hard it can grow. But as a leader, you're called to go and help that and go through its journey. And it requires a lot of patience. And you have to kind of see that vision of where that seed could be the seed doesn't know that you know, where it can go before it does. And that leaves that you believe that it can become what it can become. The see doesn't know that but it grows because of your belief in it. You know, it takes belief to put a seed in the ground and all it's going to grow. And we've seen it happen before. Don't get me wrong. But I always appreciate the fact that it's not something that's guaranteed. But if that you put the seed in the hope and what it becomes and then the fruit that bears fruit, it's pretty incredible kind of analogy for life and business. That is

Nico Johnson  29:17  
really beautiful. I feel like this is an entirely different conversation than I typically have on on SunCast To be honest, and I really love how we are just sort of riffing off of one another and, and we've spent a half hour though, usually a half hour on leadership. I feel like we could spend another half hour on that. I'd like to give folks a little bit of more perspective on the business that you've built and why you've done that. And I want to go back maybe 20 years. Do you remember the first time you met Eric?

Speaker 1  29:51  
I do it was we so me and Eric grew up in Utah. I was at Greenville Elementary. I just moved from a town A little bit further south up to to a place called North Logan, Utah on as a as a Greenville. And I think you were in my class. I just remember Eric was a very happy very nice kid. Yeah. And we'd kind of synced and he lived close by to someone that was like a daycare and I was staying at we play basketball with each other and hanging out a little bit. And I remember Eric, Eric's one of the most happy positive people I've ever met in my life. And it's something I just value so much about, Eric, because it can be really hard. And no matter what's going on, Eric is always positive, smart. He's got a smile on every laugh. Like, I just absolutely love it. But even from young kids, and we play Little League basketball together. Even though Eric smiles a lot, he can be a little bit of a pest. Yeah, I remember one of our coaches got a little bit mad at Eric because he was running around not listening. But you know, just kind of a truth ball thrown at me. He got up Yeah, basketball throwing him because he wasn't listening. So hilarious, kind of a kind of crazy that we synced up better later on in life. And here we are today, you know, growing and running a business together and a co founded a business together and eight years of friendship and run a business a lot of ups and downs. But Holly feel like we've been in sync, and I think it's because Eric has a very humble, sincere leader. And I'm very grateful for that.

Speaker 2  31:13  
Yeah, and I think life's life's journey, you know, downs, folks, you know, know each other in grade school. You know, zoom past that when you get to high school and college, we had kind of gone on our separate paths. We didn't keep in very close contact. But you know, we were always friends on social media always had, you know, good thoughts of each other. But there's at least a good decade or so where we hadn't communicated much. And then medical. You know, I had, I had did my MBA at Utah State University. Went straight back in a straight commission sales, which is another topic that was kind of scratching my entrepreneurial itch, what I wish I had from a young age, but eventually, I started eyeing the solar industry more had some friends that had gotten in and started researching the opportunity more myself and liked what I, where I thought it would go over the next decade or two. Yeah. And thought, you know, I want to get in. So I was confident in my ability to go so what

Nico Johnson  32:15  
was it that you're selling door to door?

Speaker 2  32:18  
through college? Yeah, that through college I had gotten in, you know, I, my first summer in college, I played and, you know, started the next year and had no money and I was kind of like, maybe next summer, I should do something different. So I got into the alarm, low summer sales alarm. I did a couple summers in Houston and St. Louis. And but it kind of opened my mind to just like, more opportunities post college, because, you know, you could do well, if you're willing to work hard all summer. And it was you it kind of it made college more fun, because the school year was the fun part of the year. And the dreaded part of the year. Every year was the summer. Yeah, because you're given up all the fun and you're just like, I'm gonna invest in my future and just give up my summer now so that I can have some of those dividends paid. Yeah, hey, fruit down the road. But, so. So yeah, that's where I kind of learned the skills of salesmanship. Yeah, I guess for I'm definitely believer that sales is a skill. It's just, it's just good communication with a purpose, and anyone can learn it. So I didn't consider myself the salesy type. You were in med school? Yeah. Yep. I was doing well. Not I was in pre med. Exactly. And sales is largely what changed my trajectory from continuing down that path to doing an MBA after my biochemistry degree. Is

Nico Johnson  33:43  
there someone in your life that you see you view as like they were a pivot point, they pushed you on direction procedure, or helped you see one opportunity? Yeah.

Speaker 2  33:51  
Well, that's a good question. I would have to say, my dad was the biggest influence. He's just been a model my whole life of just a good person, a good leader. He's also a business owner, but I think I was talking to him as I was starting to figure out life and college and like, I've already changed, you know, from from the same degree, but pre Dental, the pre med to pre Pharma. And I think he saw me trying to sift through all of that. Yeah. And then it was in a conversation with him where he was like, we were sorting it through, it's like, well, maybe you should think about this. And he kind of thought about the key saw that I wasn't I was geared more towards those industries for the for the money. And just will you know, if you do an MBA after that will kind of open your doors to a lot of other things. You could still get value from your science degree. So Right. I'd say it was largely my dad, in that point that mentored and just kind of gave me some advice and coaching, but I

Speaker 1  34:56  
know his dad, he's an amazing guy. At I see a lot. You know, I see Eric's down and I see Eric and he's an incredible person and it's been in the sight of a mentor to myself as well,

Nico Johnson  35:06  
man. That's wonderful. So, you left premed, got an MBA ended up ultimately, one of the sales leaders at Vivint as Vivint was getting ready to go public. So driven home solar was an extension of Vivint home Vivint alarm what was it called? Vivendi. Incas just Vivint Yeah, that's right. And which was one of the top alarm companies in the nation became the second largest solar installer in the nation was running neck and neck with Solar City and then Sunrun. And a lot of ups and downs. But inside Vivint was the embodied the culture of empowering a sales team to go out into the field, really open the solar market up to I mean, I credit Vivint for this. Yeah. Open the solar market to the door knocking SEC industry. Yep. And then with the sort of the, the recession, and as it were, in late teens in the solar industry, with Vivint, and everyone else downsizing as they needed to all those sales folks were stranded, right, they became stranded assets. And they huddled together and created sales organizations, how did that change the culture of the solar industry? As you watched it from inside Vivint? through that transition?

Speaker 2  36:24  
Yeah, no, that's a great question a lot to unpack there. I mean, for me, personally, and the way I viewed it at the time, yeah, it was exciting, because we were kind of blazing new ground, spearheading a lot of growth, and building up to go public, which was just an exciting team goal, you know, we were all working towards this. And it was fun. You know, that's where I got introduced to solar, and I learned what it can do. And this, this is, I think, mostly just the nature of a public company. It's not that there's not good public companies out there. But it was a noticeable shift. Once the IPO happened, and you started seeing some of the pressure each quarter and some of the short term decisions. And that was, I think, for me and others when we started noticing, like, all right, we like solar. But, you know, the people and some of the other folks that were fun initially started moving to the background. And so, to your point, there's a lot of sales talent, just that that was either stranded or ready for a new home. Right. And that's kind of where we I think, what spurred off kind of the the sales organization model paired with the installers or the EPC, kind

Nico Johnson  37:38  
of decoupled sales from the EPC business and a lot of ways now in meaningful ways. Yeah. Were you watching from the sidelines, as he was doing this for you guys in touch? How did you How were you tracking?

Unknown Speaker  37:48  
Yes,

Nico Johnson  37:49  
career that point?

Speaker 1  37:49  
Oh, that's funny, because I mean, I joke we grew up like more of a farm town, there's work housing people, maybe not quite that small town ish. But like Eric work in the field. I was the same way. I grew up in, in grade school, you know, working on a, like a horse barn with racehorses clean out stalls, things like that. I was grateful to young age, you know, didn't have a lot of money. So it taught me kind of the work ethic and my stories a little bit longer. I think, you know, I had some issues at home. You know, my parents got divorced when I was little, and my mom had some mental health issues. I had a hard time taking care of three boys as a single mother. You know, the state had to come in and take us out of her home. How Luckily, they were gonna go into foster homes. But my grandparents stepped in and adopted me and my brothers. And I back to the soil conversation. They they gave us good soil to become three amazing boys. Yeah, are all husbands and fathers, and both my brothers have master's degrees. If you were to know me in high school, you probably want to think I would become a personal success. Yeah. Had our time attending classes at our time focusing. You know, I barely graduated. No, you know, I was always very hard worker I just had, I just wasn't passionate about school, I'd write and enjoy the show up and do this. And you can go home when we tell you to want to be part of the mission and get it done faster. Like why would I? That's entrepreneurial, if I ever do the effort is like, I can figure that out as quickly. I don't have to dedicate the same time as everyone else. School is broken. Yeah. So, you know, I was grateful in high school, I got a job as a factory. I didn't really know what I want. And that helped me further to, I didn't want to, you know, yeah, it was hard work. And I was grateful. And I did a lot of good in the world. I met some amazing people as you work with, you know, that blue collar workforce. Some of the most amazing people I've met that are so passionate and so caring and so find I met those journeys, but you know, I was working a graveyard shift and I was like, I I met a girl. I was like, what, I need to do something if I want to, you know, progress more in life, right? So at that point, I started going back to school and I was looking at accounting. I'll always love business and when I was young kid I would I would buy basketball cards, unpackage them, repackage them and then go and sell them for more than I bought them. hustler you know, I always like I'd give my friends a good cards. You know, I always love the ability to try to make someone's day brighter. Yeah, you know, knowing that what was in those and things like that. So I think I've always had that entrepreneur, that itch and kind of Yeah, as I've gone through my journey, I went to school and counting.

Nico Johnson  40:17  
Drill down what you just said you would give your friends the good cards? Yes. Tell me more. I

Speaker 1  40:22  
just I would package the cards myself. I would pull all the cards from all the other packages by him. I'm a type one diabetic. My, you know, my grandparents would buy me basketball cards. Yes, my blood. So it was reward. I had all these cards and they're just sitting these books and I don't use these things like sounds like an everyone like they'd go to school. You trade cars at lunch? I don't know if you remember

Unknown Speaker  40:40  
the car dealer. But

Nico Johnson  40:42  
it's like, oh, like he's gonna hopium dealer. All right.

Speaker 1  40:45  
So cars are worth more than others. Like, what can I do to leverage this the Michael Jordan's, and we grew up in Utah, Utah Jazz. But I would, I would literally, like put all the cards together and decide which packs have the bad ones and which ones that didn't, and kind of understand the value and then price all of them and then I put paper around them. Put them up so people could open them. Yeah, get the surprise. I understand on the side, you'd slip your friends that really good ones. Yeah, I was like, Oh, you want this pack? Like the you know, the Michael Jordan or the rookie cards, especially cards and I saw that would brighten their day. And you know, I had some rough days at home, you know, growing up and constantly environment that I did. And like those little things just charge your battery and then they keep on it keep you going. And

Nico Johnson  41:25  
that's good. That's so I'm so glad I asked that story. Man, I need it. I'm gonna make a shirt for you hoping?

Speaker 2  41:33  
As I've known him for all these years, I've never heard I've never heard until that piece. So glad you unpacked that

Nico Johnson  41:38  
one. That's amazing, man. That's actually back to your previous question. My favorite moment? I've done 700 plus interviews. Wow. My favorite moment in these interviews is when someone says exactly I was sitting here thinking when you were telling this story. I wonder if if the employees in this company know this story to have you say, I've never heard him tell that story that for me like that is worth the hour plus drive to Mansfield. It's worth, like, putting this time aside to be able to help share that piece your story like that's, that's what I get fulfillment from. Yeah. Love it.

Speaker 2  42:13  
Love it. Yeah. Thanks for you know unpacking that. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  42:17  
I'm literally crying right now. You can leave that in Chris.

Speaker 1  42:22  
You know, me and Eric has some common threads of you know, we're both hard workers. We both kind we see the potential and people like, even though we took different paths to success, I think it's important that you for the listeners is there's no one right path to success. Yes. You know, we were meeting with the CEO of UNIVAC Peter Lorenz dinner the other night. And there's 18 of our team members there. And he said, No, to me and Eric, he said one of the things I'm impressed, he's like, your team is so diverse. Yeah. Like there's like one mold for anything it is all these people have different skills, and they're all successful. And, and I'm grateful me and Erica, I think we're good counterpart. So that I mean, Eric is so I mean, he was a perfect grade, he got perfect grades in high school. Like, I remember how smart Eric was like, he took AP Chemistry, you know, all those other minds, like get a minuses. You know, and I always wanted to be that person, but it just wasn't my personality was but and you had to work hard. You know, I was good with people. Like I said, it had the ability to make people like me, you know, I can joke and you know, I can build reports and things like that. But it's just interesting to me. And hopefully this is inspiring for your leaders is there's no one right path to six. But there's lots of paths to success. And one, if you're passionate, you have a strong purpose behind why you're doing it, and you're doing it for the right reasons. Those ups and downs don't hit as heavy as you're just doing it for money or, you know, God bless your dad. So I didn't know that story about like him kind of telling you like, you're doing this for money, go look something else. And look what you've become because of purpose. Like such an incredible story. Yeah. You know, of a father kind of being the gardener and helping his son grow. So I would

Speaker 2  43:51  
maybe add to some of those lessons and just the value in relationships and people, right. I mean, you look at us we had we were friends. And we were always friends. But we were kind of distant friends for the decade before summit started. And then

Nico Johnson  44:07  
can you tie the knot there of how like, why Boston and how that. Yeah,

Speaker 2  44:10  
so I had jumped, you know, and I won't go into the four reasons but I decided to start my solar journey in Boston. And it started in California I Boston, a good friend that had come out here. He's he's at Summit now and one of our VPs of direct sales, but he had been out here for a year and a half. So I had a few connections that were doing it in different parts of the country. And

Nico Johnson  44:33  
I assumed that it was probably Dallin was here. Yeah, not

Speaker 2  44:36  
not at the time. I was actually narrowed it down was deciding between Hawaii I had a friend there in Boston. Wow. But in my you know, using the stories or analogy terms, I felt like Hawaii at the time, which is kind of in the desert phase, which they did end up running into all the credit issues not too long after so about a year after I chose to move to Boston I got that hindsight and was like, Oh, I'm glad. Yeah, you had a lot of great constraint. Yeah. So I was already out here, downs in the West Coast. And then when I was when I was ready to do something new to start a networking out to some of my friends and connections, and I'd seen what Don had been doing on the other side of the country. He had started in California, then he was in Utah helped him build a newer company, they got to decent size in solar and solar.

Speaker 1  45:24  
I'd worked with Vivint Solar in San Diego, at Vivint. Like as an employee, yeah, as as a sales contract are similar to Eric and I remember, I had discussions, they'd given me the option, I'd kind of had to work with a gentleman, his brother was a higher up of Vivint. And I was working in the accounting, the property management company that time doing accounting and finance. He's like, You work too hard to get paid too little. He's like, go do door to door. Here's some guys making amazing money doing to getting your accounting forgot. Yeah. And so he kind of set me on a different path. He introduced me to that his brother, Doug Robinson is now the founder of legacy power. Yeah, I know, Doug is an amazing leader, amazing person. And he set up and you know, the option between Boston San Diego and Hawaii, Hawaii is a bit too far from home, I'd always dreamed of living in California. So I quit my safe secure job, you know, in accounting and finance to go sell solar door to door 100% Commission and my family told me I was crazy. I don't know. I don't know about yours, your family, five bigger beliefs. But I started it with vivid in San Diego. And then I'd actually left vivid and went to legacy that helped build that from the ground up. And then for that another company, which was Brio. And Eric had kind of seen that I've seen him on social media. And he was at the top of leaderboards of vivid, like just crushing it. And I was always the best at sales, when he went out laid plan should probably go home, this is the right position for me.

Nico Johnson  46:39  
But in the office, they told you to go out and sell in the field they told you to go back to not

Speaker 1  46:44  
very good at this. Tell him what I can learn. So you know, I read books, and I emulated what the top people were doing. I don't remember well, yeah, yeah. And I just didn't I just I showed up every day. And I put in a lot of work. And then finally success and greatest leaders. And I I like I said, what you go through your growth through? Yeah, and just that belief. So it's kind of crazy. We both started with Fitbit. And I'm very grateful for women. Now they started a lot of entrepreneurs, they hadn't really changed a lot people came from that have changed the thing. But yeah, pretty incredible. We both worked for Vivint. Yeah,

Speaker 2  47:13  
yeah, exactly. We saw what we had seen passively what each other was doing. And then I just messaged him and said, Hey, I want to hear more about what you've been doing out there. And that's where, you know, we started talking again, and summit started 2016. So it's been a journey ever since. And

Speaker 1  47:33  
timing is everything in life, you know, you can start to worry too soon. But I was kind of as I'd work with this other company, it was a big fan of the ethics they were they were misleading people out production. And they were doing LED bulbs and smart thermostat and saying this is offset energy 20%. And I love solar. But I wasn't a fan of some of those. And I had some ethical dilemmas with my business partners there. So I was wanting to leave and Eric and literally call the exact moments like, Hey, I'm thinking about doing my own thing. I'm not enjoying the public. And I'm like, I'm actually leaving, I want to do my own thing. You know, let's see if there's a company aligned. And we looked around, we couldn't find one that we felt how slow should be done? Yeah. So we kind of looked each other. What do we do at this point, if you can't find a company, we feel like because the lines of how people should be treated slow should be done. Like, maybe we should start our own. Yeah. And some it was born out of that vision of you know, to create a company, you know, it was known for doing things the right way, but so

Nico Johnson  48:21  
amazing. There's so much that we won't be able to get into around just from time constraints around the way that like I was mentioning the iconography, you did a really good job explaining it in the in the live broadcast. I'll point folks to to that if they want to dig more into kind of how you have put physical labels around the way culture works here. Sure. But I want to talk about that good soil, because you both come out of sales. And I asked you this in the webinar, and I remember saying I'm gonna have to drill down on that. Yeah. So you both come out of sales. You're gonna start an operating company and EPC you're gonna go put this stuff on roofs, not just put it and I'll just put fliers on doors. You're not just hanging, you know, hanging door hangers. How do you build a team around you for the skill sets that you likely haven't built yet? Because operations in this business is very complex? Yeah. I

Speaker 2  49:19  
mean, for us, every company has its own backstory for us. I would I would go back to the relationships. Yeah. You know, prior to Summit, we and our belief has gotten more depth and it's more well rounded. But we were already believers in just people and treating people well. And so as summit was starting, you know, our first six months we were the sales or peace, okay. But we quickly decided we were always in it for longer term. So we quickly decided, hey, but I gave you some early revenue. Yeah, exactly. Got the revenue turning and we quickly decided to get where we want to go long. Turn on customer experience on culture, all these things we need to be more vertically integrated.

Nico Johnson  50:05  
So a lot of Salesforce is having that conversation right now. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2  50:09  
And so, you know, fortunately we we started a while back and we have some history and we're growing you know, we have our own Growing Pains burrowing Inc

Nico Johnson  50:17  
5000. Now what, three years in a row? Well, coming up to officially two official Yeah, I'm gonna demand see your chance. I'm gonna will you into the yard here? I think. So keep going. Yeah, I

Speaker 2  50:31  
think so. So anyways, as we're getting going and looking at moving into the operational side, it was all about just bringing on the right people. Yeah, I mean, we obviously had to have what was what were

Nico Johnson  50:42  
if you think about it, from like, a team building a team sports team? Yeah. What are the first positions you have to fill? If I like speak specifically to those folks that are trying to answer this question for their business business right now? What were the first positions that you filled? Maybe you filled some too early? Or some too late? Like how would you? How would you arrange the seats at the table? Looking back on it? Now?

Speaker 2  51:04  
That's a great question. And I think that answer will be a little bit different for every business course. Because we obviously needed to round out what strengths we have had and needed others to complement that. So for us as sales heavy, we had sales, and I'd say business pretty good business. Just strategy. Yeah, pretty pretty well. We needed some just, we're gonna do construction, we need some construction experience. So we found some some guys that have been, you know, one is doing some other things, but was instrumental in our early days. Another one still with us today. You know, Jim, he's our one of our license holder, massive master electricians, he'd been in the Army Corps of Engineers. He's actually a town inspector in Massachusetts. So he's got that lens from the inspector point.

Nico Johnson  51:58  
Which has a there's a lot of integrity to that as exactly

Speaker 2  52:00  
because we're, we're beginning with the end in mind. He was he was having the the down the site view for depth of all the things that are wrong. Exactly. projects that aren't now we thought were preventing all of these. Yeah, we got backwards that like that. Exactly. We early on, we got one of our own engineers, a solar engineer. And he was earlier career but between our master electrician who had decades of experience of seeing the end results, working with engineer, that was a powerful combination. Justin's just been a huge willing to wear any and every hat. He's the third, you know, number three at Summit, and he's now our Senior VP of Operations. But he's, I mean, we bootstrapped we didn't start with money, we still have an asterisk. Exactly. We're still organically growing buzzing to Justin, I look back at Justin he was you need some utility players that are willing to kind of dive anything and everything. We would be at dinners and he would literally take a call and leave for 10 minutes and go update a design or something like that. He literally had his laptop like 24/7 It was like, like a bag of like, I don't know how he did that for like for pretty good period of time,

Speaker 1  53:16  
a lot of sacrifice. And it, I think back at me and Eric had both worked at other companies, and were able to pull based on relationships. And like I said, some of the top talent for these other people. Yeah, Chad, who is one of the original founders, you know, the company was a young kid just in college, but he was a great store designs, right intelligent kid was software like we'd pulled him over from he was another company, you know, with Brad, and they kind of handled the software stuff. And me and Eric know how to do sales and marketing. And I remember just like, Alright, we gotta go get our first sale. And I went and sat with a homeowner. And they're like, the first question they asked me is, well, how long have you been in business? Right? I was like a day. Yeah. But storytelling, yeah. Tell them the story, the vision of summer, what we're doing, how we're going to overcome and work with the NPC has been in the business long time, things like that. And a lot of people don't think about that. But how do I get started, but you need to share your vision, your purpose, why and family bought into that I was very grateful. And when we had that first sale, you know, Eric, you're probably the same way had the same questions from consumers. Well, how long have you been in business like a month, it's hard to get out and you're gonna get a lot more knows that you get yeses in the beginning. Yeah. However, you can't allow those to deter you. And we're able to pull all these different Jim pre court was, you know, 65 at the time and 230 year old kids are telling him they're gonna start a solar business and grow into something and he believed in us and all these people came together, and the more people came, and we built a culture where people wanted to join, it's continued compounding. That's

Speaker 2  54:36  
it. It really was about the vision and the belief and being able to transfer that belief into the people that join us because that's when we've been grateful we're big believers in gratitude as far as the hope ism. I don't know if I think of a good word. I don't know if you have a good word for gratitude that similar but I think it's another powerful. We from the early days were were was grateful from number 234 up to the few hundreds that have been trusted their journey to come build with us. And I think people have felt that and it's an it's it's helped them buy in and believe in it more as well. And it's allowed us to get some people that were like, Oh, wow, they're really coveted join us and help us build. And it helps us go next level.

Nico Johnson  55:22  
People talk about culture. But I've seen you all really infuse culture in a very specific, methodical way. And the only time I've seen that in another company that was public about it, Tony Shea and Zappos have the culture book. And I wonder if that's where you got the idea from, but you guys have spent 10s of 1000s of dollars on documenting the culture of Summit, so that your team, so it's like, under no uncertain circumstance, you understand? There's a roadmap for what, for what being a part of Summit? Yes, like, Yeah. and talk and talk about fun and how that gets integrated into culture and the justification of that expense? Because even you started so early, from the very beginning. And that, for me, and for many others is like, how do I even talk about how much time I want to allocate to that concept when I have so many moles to whack as business owner? Right fires to put out?

Speaker 2  56:19  
No, I love the question. And we won't be able to deep dive, because of you know, due to the sake of time, but it's a subject that we're super passionate about. And I was smiling when you brought up Tony shakes, I was trying to remember in my head when we spoke last fall, if he had come up or not, he actually has been an inspiration for us. And I'll come back to that. But you know, just going back to our belief and people Yeah. And and some of the discussions we've had on creating the right environment and nurturing the soil to allow seeds to flourish. i People are more productive when they're happy, and they're having fun. Yeah. So. And we understand that. So we've tried to just, we try to have fun as we're doing business, there's no reason why you can't we still have challenges. Yeah, just like a sports game, you're gonna have your tough quarters or your tough minutes or your tough periods. But the end of the day, like you're playing a game, that's fun, it gives you the opportunity to overcome challenges to try to win the game to do all these things together. Right? You're doing it together. Yeah. So I mean, there's reasons why people parallel business and sports so often. But I mean, some of the, on the Tony Shea front. We were just big believers in learning. Yeah. And we look at Summit as a verb more than we do the noun. So the act of somebody. It's the day to day the constant journey, the climbing, the becoming, that's an important part, the journey of Summit. So from the early days of the company, we've been learners, where we're big. We're big on reading. Yeah. And over the years, there are certain books that just resonate with you very strongly, right. And we've been able to pick some of those out and say, these, these are like foundational to our beliefs. Yeah. And so we've made sure one as we're growing, and we're selecting new leaders to make sure we're getting the right cultural fits. And then we also, then big on asking everyone to acclimate to summits, culture, again, mountains, and we have core readings that have been around since the early days of the business. And, you know, just to rattle them off, but not dive in, you know, leadership and self deception. A paradigm shifting book just gives a framework on how to see people as people, not objects,

Nico Johnson  58:42  
leadership, and self destruct. Yep,

Speaker 2  58:44  
yeah. And then peak by Chip Conley, right. And that will actually tie strongly to Tony Shea, because he was big and sprayed. A Chip Conley, his framework was a big inspiration to Tony Shea, right, that Zappos actually considered themselves a peak company. Is that right? Because, yep. They basically, Chip Conley took a lot of studying of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and made a framework to apply that psychology to business does

Unknown Speaker  59:15  
you think names peak either Yeah.

Speaker 2  59:19  
And you think of Maslow, it's, it's all positive psychology, it's all seeing the potential in people right. So that's, that's been huge for us. That's our kind of second core reading piece by Chip Conley. And then the third one is more operational as far as how do we execute? And just given us a good business operating system that that helps us execute strategies. It's the four disciplines of execution Okay. To its Covey.

Nico Johnson  59:46  
Yeah, that's not what I thought you're gonna say traction. We've,

Speaker 2  59:49  
we've read traction and gleaned some good good things from traction as well. But it's not

Nico Johnson  59:55  
the four disciplines Yeah, of execute execution. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  59:59  
But if

Speaker 2  1:00:01  
I think of the before we veer off, you think of those ones as foundational. That's like our super core value. How do we see people right? Then you get into more of the philosophies? How do we empower people and lift them up with Maslow and they'll the framework? And then our third is just like, Alright, how are we going to operate next? Q So feel free if you were to walk around. Another big thing we've done with cultures, we're really intentional on language. Yeah, we speak and not reflecting our beliefs. But one of the summit words, we have our own vocabulary as you walk around, you almost need a dictionary to be asked what is all this Yeah, glossary. But you'll hear wig frequently wig, it's not about wearing wigs, that's actually comes from for dx. It's wildly important goal. And so you'll hear a little words like that, that we've learned from from these different places and integrate them into the business. And then a few years back, actually don't think we got this from Tony Shea, we have read some of his books. So maybe it was just hiding out in the brain somewhere. But we did years ago, we looked at where we wanted to be, and our biggest fear was losing the culture that we were creating and fostering. And so we made an investment. It was around $20,000, to build a culture and Brand Book that kind of was a good way for people that were joining the company. And for those that were already here to just reinforce some of the core principles and look at that. And yeah, yeah, we'll show you. And at the time, when we made the investment it was it was kind of that hurt. That's a golf, do we invest in this? Or do we invest in leads, you know, that will give us business now? And those are the sacrifices that you have to make, to to really build the business to where you want to be? It's, it's if if we hadn't made those sacrifices, then we wouldn't be where we're at today. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  1:02:02  
Guys, I would love three more hours with you. And I'm sure others watching and listening would as well. And I wonder, because you're so intentional about internally, providing resources. does your website have resources for folks that may want to that may see summit as emblematic of the kind of company they would build HOW IT folks that are connect with you, or the ideas that have made you and we the kind of business that someone has become? Well, the

Speaker 1  1:02:31  
easiest way would be to join Summit. Yeah, go learn pretty quick, when you get dive right into the fire. But those are some great thoughts. Nico, you know, how do we do that? You know, we've developed some at university, where we actually have ongoing classes and teaching and I mean, that's all

Nico Johnson  1:02:47  
internal. Yeah. That's your homeboy our onboarding process here. Right? That's correct.

Speaker 1  1:02:52  
So I think we have the sun we could further develop is I don't know if he shared that with our customers enough. And, you know, the outside world, right. It's kind of internal to Summit. Yeah. But I think those you know, those those for those books, trust inspires another phenomenal one trust that is by Yeah, leadership, leadership, it's really changed the way I lead and see people and their potential phenomenal book. But I mean, as we've gone through these different stages, a lot of times you hit a ceiling. And what's next, how do I solve this problem? Yeah, you know, mentors is a good way. But one thing, I'm very grateful, both me and Eric, because we're passionate about reading. Yeah, anytime that I had a problem, I would go find a book. And then it would give me ideas of how to solve that problem. And then when you're 30 year old, you know, we're two co founders of a business, you're 30 years old leading guys who are in their 50s and 60s, how do you do that, and you go and educate yourself and grow as an individual. So we're just a firm believer in education and reading and constantly and then it's also a good alignment tool. If everyone's reading the same book at the same time. They're all on the same frequency and operating at the same level the same time. And that's when magic happens is on everyone's on the same page. And books are a phenomenal way to do that. Because you're talking about the book and you're talking about ideas in the book. And then you wonder if I know we're going short on time, that's

Nico Johnson  1:04:02  
okay. I would encourage you guys if you haven't already to publish the list of books that form the core philosophy of your company and publish them on your website. The website is love that summit summit solar.com it solar.com Or you could go to WWE summit.com I love that I'm the one I love the most. That's not the most summit.com Yeah, if you if you you know I think that you've got to you've your team is working on expanding on that brand. So I would encourage probably by the time this publishes that will all be now it's sort of be published and more prevalent. And Chris and the team I know we're working on refreshing how that all look so under percent. If you want to learn more about how these gentlemen have infused this culture into their company in the way that you can see it as a customer as a potential team member or as just an admirer go to WWE summit.com I want to have I have one final question for you guys. You can give a shared answer or, or individually but if we look out To 2050 Yep. Right. And the solar industry is now it's now mature, we have solar on, let's call it 50% of the homes in America. And solar contractors aren't solar contractors anymore as Jigar Shah said, you're no longer in the solar business, you're in the, in the virtual power plant business, during the energy, the shared energy business. What did we as an industry, fix, or get right? to land there, like we're looking back from there.

Speaker 1  1:05:39  
Back to some of the leadership is what we became as a society going through the journey. That transitions are hard changes hard, but they're required and what we grow through what we go through, we grow through and that's right, I think we'll look back as a society. And we are amazed by what we accomplished, right? I think sometimes we underestimate and we get So focusing on who's right and who's wrong, left or right, that we focus that we're all in this together, and we sum it together. You know, we always say we saw it for a planet, we saw it for a future, we saw it for our children. Hopefully, we're further ingrained, have a purpose driven society. Yeah, that's sees each other as people and working on each other's behalf to make a better world, how but I think what we've become a society as we go through that energy transition, I think is something that will be the most grateful for,

Speaker 2  1:06:25  
I think Dallin hit the nail on the head for me, so I won't elaborate much more. But you know, the we summit for our children concept, what are our kids and our kids, kids and their kids gonna look back at our generation and be grateful for that we did that we made the sacrifices to push on and that we prioritized. And it's the same for us, we can look back, you know, at previous generations, that did amazing things that have given us all the opportunities today. You know, here in the United States, all the infrastructure and just the amazing country that we have, let's let's keep building it, let's believe in what we can do as a country and as a nation, and what we can do and empower the rest of the world. And let's let's leave a place to where our kids and their kids look back at our generation. They're like, Oh, we're grateful that they prioritize these things and pushed hard on these things, because they were important to leave it the world in a better spot for us when we were here, right? And then hopefully, they can continue on that legacy. And

Speaker 1  1:07:32  
that's very why our mission statement is what it is. It's a very infinite, we empower people. We'll vote tomorrow. Yeah, let's empower ourselves to make change. Let's make the sacrifices to make a better thing for tomorrow. And that's an infinite game. Yeah, it's not a one time thing. It's not something it's not lofty. It's everyone can participate. And everyone can empower themselves, or their teammates to make a better tomorrow. And I'm so grateful to for our mission statement and the purpose behind it. It's why we wake up every day and come to work and love. I mean, we love what we do, right? Yeah, I

Speaker 2  1:08:05  
get battery charged, just coming in every day. If it was a long night, or like more long, long morning or whatever else when I come in, and I'm just around our people, I get recharged. And it's it's beautiful. So I guess back to a couple questions back Miko. I mean, I've we love connecting with people in person. We love learning from other people's journeys. And you know, we're big believers in sharing knowledge and sharing best practices. So we're happy to connect individually, you know, however, that happens, whether it's at a conference or through an introduction, or, you know, whatever their method, but we just love learning from other people as well. So we're happy to connect.

Speaker 1  1:08:45
