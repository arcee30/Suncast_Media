Speaker 1  0:00  
We want to be thought of more as the three pillars of, I'd say solar storage and Evie. the electrification of the US grid is certainly happening. And we really want to have probably 100 products in the portfolio to address the growing companies, the companies are growing and creating 1000s of jobs, and really 10s of 1000s of jobs in construction. And we want to be their strongest partner and ally, to help them get there quicker.

Nico Johnson  0:27  
Whether you building a small business, or trying to scale to take on multi national competitors, the topic of growth and leadership are synonymous with startup. Every leader I know who's ever started or taken over a business struggles with how do I get folks to think, as a team? How do I productize our offering in a way that allows us to take over market share from our competitors. In today's tactical Tuesday, we're getting a very practical advice from someone who's been exactly where you are for where you may find yourself very soon. If you're new to SunCast welcome in thank you for tuning in. This is what we call a tactical Tuesday. It is practical guidance from our front lines, solar warriors, those who are out with leading the clean energy transition, have known today's guest Brian Wagner for quite some time. And I've watched as he's grown from regional leader to GM and president of the number one market share three phase inverter manufacturer here in the United States chant power systems. Many of you have been watching and are probably aware of the growth and the scale that chant has been able to achieve. But are you familiar with the struggle? Are you familiar with the ways that the leadership and the team have often as in every other company presents a challenge for Brian and his executive team? We're going to dig into that and more Today you'll learn more about their Lightspeed framework for growth, you'll learn more about how they fell from number one position and fought back to achieve it not once but seven years in a row. We'll dig into Brian's leadership, philosophy and so much more. Remember, there's more than 700 episodes just like this in our back catalogue. I hope that you will subscribe so that you will be notified each and every week, twice a week when we publish an episode, I would encourage you to go check out the back catalogue, including one of Brian's favorites on impostor syndrome. With Paula Glover. There's so much you can learn here. But today, I want you to get ready to tune in and tune up your skill solar warrior as we check out another practical tactical episode here on SunCast. Well, Brian, I know that we are going to dig into a lot of the detail about how and why you have chosen the path or the path has chosen you as it were. But first, I want to say thank you for taking the time out of your very busy schedule to join us here on SunCast. Yeah,

Speaker 1  3:06  
Nikko, thanks for having me today, and just couldn't be more excited to be on one of the more famous shows in the industry, I think you helped create the podcast industry, for solar. So just congrats to you. And like I said, I'm thrilled to be on. Thanks,

Nico Johnson  3:23  
my friend. Well, I appreciate the kindness. And I look forward to helping folks really dig in to some of the things that have presented themselves as challenges stumbling blocks in your leadership and growth. Today, we're gonna look at navigating that process of growth and scaling a multinational company. In this case, it's chimp power systems, you all created a process that when I became familiar with it, I immediately knew this is something I want to share with our SunCast audience. You call it the Lightspeed framework, we'll dig into that and how you use it for efficient management planning and in person collaboration, sort of team building, we'll get into your, your team work sort of triangle methodology, there's a whole lot of things that we want to better understand and navigate. But I think that actually, where we should probably begin, is how the terminology impacts the thing that we're describing. Of course, SunCast is first and foremost has has predominantly been a solar industry show for also a leadership and sort of an evergreen leadership philosophy shows we're going to dig into both sides. I mentioned earlier that you are the global leader for three phase string inverter. And that can sound quite convoluted for someone who's unfamiliar when you do a quick intro for us to the specific technology around which Chen power has become known and for which you've become the market leader.

Speaker 1  4:43  
Yeah, I think I think to make it simple and basic, if you kind of think of the early days of an SMA, sonny boy, right string inverter in your garage. You know, when I first got in the industry 2008 That was an inverter that was, you know, something we were We're using on small, commercial and residential homes. So shout out to one of our friends at SMA. But certainly, yeah, we as a brand as CPS, we are the known technology of choice for history, one out of every two commercial projects in the US, it's a string inverter. So, you know, 10 years ago, I would say around 2014, yeah, NEC 2014 code is what kind of got string onto the map for the technology. And, you know, here we are today where that's the preferred method, I'd say nowadays from a one, you know, 200 kilowatt system, 100 kilowatt system all the way to 20 megawatt system, kind of that commercial scope of commercial buildings, you know, small, round metal carport applications everywhere.

Nico Johnson  5:49  
I remember when CPS introduced what at the time was extremely revolutionary. It was the 30 kilowatt string inverter, it was transformerless, you could mount it on the wall, I had less than a year prior done a 30 kilowatt sat con inverter that was the size of a refrigerator. And I told ed at the time was him and this is revolutionary the idea that not only is it transformers, but that I could mount it on the wall that one team member with a little help could mount a 30 kilowatt inverter was was revolutionary. So So CPS has historically been able to introduce these technological innovations. Is it true? I heard someone say one time that CPS champ power systems a company that is the global sort of parent company is like the GE of China's that right.

Speaker 1  6:40  
So yeah, actually, we've been referred to by our customer in the past few years, the avg. So yeah, I'd say we're a global industrial energy company. And one, you know, like all companies, you have manufacturing base everywhere. So for our our US products, today, we're manufacturing mainly in Thailand, we still have multiple locations globally. We still manufacture a lot from China. But yeah, we're we're mainly for US market in Thailand right now. And we're certainly looking even at the US, you know, us content, we've done us content in the past us assemble products that attaches in the past.

Nico Johnson  7:19  
You know, I think that it's fair to say and what was perhaps referred to even internally as like CPS 1.0, like back in the day, when Ed and Casey were leading the introduction of the brand into the US that most people associated the product as an OEM for companies like select tree. In fact, the early my early introduction was realizing, Oh, this select Tria product that I love so much is actually made by CPS. And I find that a lot of customers did in fact, sort of have that affinity, that association with CPS because they were introduced through not unlike GE, a brand that you were manufacturing on behalf of. And as you took on leadership circa 2016. I'm really curious to better understand the brand position of CPS coming out of that umbrella of being a subcontractor and OEM to a more customer facing brand to try and reveal a brand of itself. How many customers did you have then? Versus now? Where was the revenue, then versus now and then let's talk about what it took to get there.

Speaker 1  8:28  
When I got here in 2016. We were struggling we were we were number one market share in 2015, for the first time for three days straight back down, that was a very small market. So Latteria II was just exiting the three phase string market, which it purchased a company you know, I came from a sorted heading KC, formerly CPS leadership. So I think he was just exiting. And then you had a handful players like even power one back then ABB, if you remember, before, for ABB power one was kind of exiting, you know, you had maybe an SMA still around or getting into three phase string, you know, for the US market because a lot of folks 10 years earlier, we're doing or at least at that time, maybe five, seven years earlier, we're doing string, right, for commercial and in Europe, mainly. And yeah, so you had you had a you had really at that time, I'd say like a Chinese company, you know, being being our parent company, really was not in the US market. You know, then there's been there's got to be hundreds of companies that have been trying to get in this market for a long time. Right. I think one of the strategies we had with with select Korea really wasn't ever to be in the position where now it just kind of happened that way being that we are a strong engineering team. We're a strong manufacturing team and we kind of backed into what we're what we do nowadays, you know, I'd say 2015 being 48% market share of three phase string at that time 36% was electric at 12 per Sound the CPS, so we were just getting on the scene. And if you looked at a year prior your two years prior, we weren't even a known brand. So we are getting there very quick. But again, the market was very small back then 2016 When I came to CPS early, early 2016, when I came to CPS, we actually dropped from the number one market share in three phase string, we had some quality challenges, some reliability challenges back then, around some of the early products, there are only products with the fourteens, the 20s. And then the 2328 had a like a capacitor challenge. Actually, many of the products back then had that similar challenge. And usually that's the case it's a component that makes up the burger. So we had recovered when I first got here, it was like having conversations were very challenging. It was every conversation was, oh, yeah, we know you. You know, you're having some quality kids, you know, so it was like, it was tough. I'd say back then we had about five customers purchasing our direct brand. Five, yeah, yeah, it was it was probably in the 2016 range. It was probably in the five to 10 range throughout the whole country. And

Nico Johnson  11:02  
that equated to 10s of millions of dollars in revenue still.

Speaker 1  11:05  
Yeah, well, not for CPS, CPS was at that point, probably under $5 million business, you know, $10 million. Yeah, it was very small. When I first got here, but this the Selectric brand is what made up the lion's share probably 80% of the revenue. You know, if you fast forward today, our CPS brand is about 1000 customers, direct customers Wow, believe it or not selector is still our strongest partner and our strongest, largest customer. So we actually are really excited that we can use that partnership. And we kind of have a saying internally to our partnership is that in some cases, we compete in some cases, we are partners, right? And what's really important to us is that the technology is continuing to advance. We're building more solar projects, you know, we've done almost 20,000 projects or nearly 20,000 projects now. So, you know, fast forward today, you know, our market share for 2023 was 31%, I think select your just got to 4% market share. So combined, you know, we're a third of the market today. And again, most of the lion's share of that is our own brand. We've had to build our you know, when I first got here, we probably had 10 people in the company. So we now are over 100. You know, we've kind of had to grow up, if you

Nico Johnson  12:20  
will. Yeah, that's tremendous. So let's talk about that growing up phase. So from CPS 1.0, to what maybe CPS 2.0, and then maybe even further to 3.0, we'll talk a bit about some of the product introductions that need to happen. I mean, it's really almost unfathomable to go from five customers to over 1,200x growth in customers alone, which represents a tremendous sales effort. But also, I think, a tremendous marketing effort to position the product out from under the sort of the shadow of the OEM that that support select Tria to the brand that could support direct customers. Can you talk a bit about some of the the devil in the details for you taking over leadership from these iconic, enigmatic leaders? Adam, Casey, everyone knew and you coming from regional sales to the demand in charge? What were some of the early opportunities that you identified and hurdles that you needed to overcome? Good question,

Speaker 1  13:17  
I would say you're definitely only ever as good as your team. So I first would start off by saying that Edie and Casey were tremendous mentors. You know, Casey actually worked for him for a short time at EY. And then he brought him here. So I have to really give Casey shout out for that. And JC is actually a partner now and energy storage, we worked with them in a brand is called electricity. And we're doing a tremendous job together now tackling CNI energy storage. So that's exciting. And we just deployed our first projects together, which is our second or third generation of CNI energy storage. But I'd also like to highlight since about the topic, Kevin Purdy was my real mentor, he from learning the inverter business, you know, one of the books we had the team reasons shoot up, I highly recommend if you haven't, oh, yeah, yeah, that's a tremendous one. And we call ourselves inverter dogs couple years ago, trying to, you know, come up with so I would say there's a few prior to me hear, that have really made an impact on the CPS brand, and really the industry as a whole. So I'm kind of lucky enough or fortunate enough to be in the position I'm in but nowadays, the likes of you know, James Oswald, our service directors, he Han Yi, who's one of the more recent leaders with us and Tom Paton, who's been with us for years, John drum and Steve bounder, Brian Baxter, Kelly Sham. I mean, there's a whole team nowadays and there's a lot of emerging talent in our office in Jersey and in in Texas. So we're so I say, we're so fortunate that, you know, I guess I'm in a position where, you know, maybe I get to spike the ball a little bit if you use that analogy, you know, at times, but I think we love to kind of do the touchdown celebration together. So I would say I'll start with the team. And I'd say it's it's mainly the, the team that has kind of brought this mentality of how we get projects built Quicker, quicker and quicker. But I first came in and that pandemic, I mean, it was, it was kind of crazy to come in back in early 2020, in the interim role for probably a year and a half and going to, you know, finally getting into GM and then GM and President. It's been quite a growing path for me, you know, you had that imposter syndrome podcast recently I listened to I told you, I loved it, because, you know, you have that almost every, almost every month, do you have that almost every quarter? And, you know, am I, someone that is able to take the company from where we are now to the next level? You know, so what I'd say is the Team Drives, the team drives you to be great. And you got to know when I come in on a Monday morning, like today's Monday, it's like we got to be, we got to be great. You know, we got to be great. We got to drive to be great. So, you know, excited about that, Brian,

Nico Johnson  15:58  
when you set before the team, the challenge of going from not less than 50 million to over 100 million in revenue from less than a dozen customers to over 1000 customers, what were the underlying sort of hurdles to growth? And how did you approach addressing those hurdles with strategic frameworks that enabled you to achieve the aggressive goals and targets that you all set for yourselves as a team, I

Speaker 1  16:26  
would say, you know, some of the hurdles to our growth was in the beginning was, you know, we were starting, and I was starting this position more in the pandemic. So there were several, there's chip shortages, there was all kinds of hurdles, I'd say the first thing we had was in supply chain. We had, you know, containers coming from overseas, you know, 1218 months, we tighten that down to, I think, eight weeks, quickly, and we never missed a single shipment in the whole pandemic. So hats off, and kudos to any Lin who's our, our head supply chain. She's done a tremendous job. And I'd say, you know, we had looked at things like that, right, looked at the team and said, Okay, and what parts where, you know, somebody like Annie, who is not even in leadership at that time, but she's doing all the work of that department. And we said, let's, let's move her into a leadership role. And she just took it in stride. So she's been doing tremendous. I'd say we looked at similar in our Lightspeed system down in Texas, you know, Lightspeed is kind of a framework that, you know, we coined inside the company. I couldn't I could talk more about that, if you like, I think we, we had maybe James Oswald, who's our service director down in Texas, probably 2025 people at the time reporting to him who said, Hey, let's move that to five pillars to start. We had Fabiola who's tremendous in service engineering. We call it Performance Engineering. Now, James Whipple, who's in service engineering, you know, we have been who's in technical support running a team now, you know, kind of the pillars you have the warehouse, you know, all these things happening. And it was kind of like, how do we how do we how do we build it together as a team? Yeah, we can kind of think about the growth that's going to happen when we look when we go from, say, you know, 10,000 systems deploy to 20,000 systems deploy? Yeah, I think we were kind of in the years past, we were kind of a startup, like you said, but we're really nowadays more of an entrepreneurial mindset, thinking three to five years out strategically on what can we do different so that Lightspeed was different for us? You

Nico Johnson  18:33  
mentioned pillars, can you be specific about what you mean by pillars in this context,

Speaker 1  18:38  
leadership, leadership. So certainly, there is Truong in CPS labs. There's there's Beaven in technical support. There's Fabiola and in performance engineering, there's dreams Whipple and service engineering. They were the pillars and the foundation, Josh, and warehousing pillars of the foundation of that success. Certainly James being the quarterback there. Yeah. Now I think we have eight pillars and you know, probably double or triple the size of the team. Perfect.

Nico Johnson  19:06  
So what I hear you saying is you started to identify core operating units within the organization in the early and let's call it CPS one data, it was really very heavily sales oriented, right? We had

Speaker 1  19:21  
basically to simplify it, it was three departments, products, you start product sales and service, you got to know something and you got to service it. And everything really ran through three, three departments, if you will, but again, when I came here, we were to 10 people, maybe we got to 1520 people I could still do Okay, right, you know,

Nico Johnson  19:41  
so what you noticed is that, as the growth happened internally as a team and customer focus, that what you're referring to is pillars, which could be also simplified as departments needed to be more well defined. And you started to build systems and processes around each one of these departments or pillars. So that the foundational is playbook could be adapted and run from each individual pillar or department. Is that right?

Speaker 1  20:05  
That's correct. It does. The Lightspeed is more of a collaboration of that.

Nico Johnson  20:09  
So introduce us to the concept of this Lightspeed framework where it came from and how you began to apply it to CPS at a at an pillar, focus level. So

Speaker 1  20:21  
I'd say like in 2021, you know, heading into 2022, we made this three year plan, which was, hey, we want to triple the size of the business, which we're on our way to doing. And we will accomplish this year. And we also want to triple the size of the team, which we've already done. So the economy, we kind of wanted to triple the size of the team ahead of the growth in the past, we kind of would grow and then add two more, one, two more, and, and then you kind of you'd kind of, you know, so we, it was kind of uncomfortable, certainly for me for finance, kind of learning that side of the world and how you got to make every quarter we're fortunate right? Now we just hit our, what is it 31 of 32 quarters consecutively, our goals, you know, you got to set realistic goals, but then you got to execute. And I think, talking about and the vision, and what you're going to do is, I would say it's fun, it's creative, it's fun work, but it's not easy work to actually realize it. So I'd say I'm mostly focused on it. My background pumping from sales and execution was mostly focusing on the execution of building this, what we call Lightspeed system, which went from basically these three departments to maybe 15 to 20. Now, and you had to have 1520 leaders that you needed to identify quickly, or recruit them in quickly, to say, Okay, this is, what we're going to do is we're going to be 100 person company in the next three years, I think there was many skeptics that didn't believe that even inside the company, I'd say mainly, you know, we had a little bit of turnover about back then 21, and maybe a little bit into 22. But But yeah, nowadays, I think our retention rate, I think we've lost one or two people in the last couple of years. It's phenomenal. You know, I think it's north of 95% right now, and just just done tremendous. But it's been about the team. It's been about it sounds so simple, Nico, but really, it's about the relentless customer focus experience, and making sure that that's what we're focused on. You know, I told you earlier, we've done a lot of different books. One of the ones we have one of the folks came from a Starbucks, right? And then we read Starbucks experience with their come in, do a tasting. And, you know, every little thing we do is thinking about when that person calls, how are we handling it? Right. And nowadays, if my phone's ringing too much, one day, it's, you know, mostly the team, they need to know who to get ahold of more. That's been hard. I think, you know, hurdles, you talked about hurdles, releasing kind of the, you know, not control, but you know what I mean? Like, you know, you can't have your eyes on every little thing. Yeah. And as the team get more strategic and create more of a vision of what that customer experience needs to be and, you know, then then have the customers live in. Brian Eno, you

Nico Johnson  22:59  
mentioned the Starbucks book, and one of the employees that came from Starbucks could have gave you ideas, and I love how I've continually seen you pull from great leaders in other areas, where have you drawn inspiration in the formation of the Lightspeed system? And then let's dig into what the least Lightspeed system is, as well? Sure,

Speaker 1  23:18  
and I know we've talked about this in the past and ego, but you know, I grew up with an athletic background. So you know, gym rat playing three, four, sports was always how I thought about Yeah, who I want to emulate Derek Jeter, someone's famous like that right? But But I think, as I got into the business world, trying to apply some of the same methods to investing or other things that I was wanting to learn about, just became natural that leadership was something probably 20 years ago, I started really study, you know, I maybe took a lot of the athletic mind and background and applied it to business, which those analogies usually do pretty well, whether it's athletic background or not. So I'd say you know, the Lightspeed coming from you know, it came from a combination of many things we learned, we have a learning culture inside CPS, we're obsessed with learning. That's both inside the company training, as well as taking outside resources outside consultants. And I'll, I'll talk about that in a minute. But But learning is at the like, it's a culture that we really ingrained every quarter. We're trying to improve ourselves and what we want to do so Lightspeed took a life of its own when we had some of the team watch the movie, the founder, which was about McDonald's, and they had this thing called the speedy system, right where the system was, you know, how they have the different stations making products and what we what I thought about is, all these years in the inverter business, how can I apply some of those methods that I was naturally doing as individual to the team and bring it to the team so we can teach the, you know, in our playbook, there's probably 1000 Maybe 2000 plays in the inverter business. So we said, okay, when this happens, this play happens. Here's what we do. And then we took another method which was from from, I think one of the athletic books we read, which was 11 rings came from Harlock. But it was really Phil Jackson and the Chicago Bulls that I kind of grew up watching, you know, triangle offense is say, you know, you have two individuals working on working on a project, right, they usually need to get that third person, sometimes in the best, it's three different departments working together to kind of create a triangle offense to carry it to the next department. So now that we're 1520 departments, if sales gets a call about service, they know to route it to, to service and if service gets a call to sale, you know, it's, it's a team that works with one another. And it's very easy to kind of see the finished concept, but do to create all that hard work. And, you know, we call it mistakes, right? I mean, mistakes happen along the way. It's more learning, and how you handle that are you coachable? So for us, that's one of the most important criteria is when we do hire and recruiting Ryan in our office in New Jersey doing tremendous job recruiting, you know, we've we've used consultants energy works as well, you know, that's the first question we ask is, Are you right with explain that to us? Yeah, it's, it's been a, it's been awesome to see the team kind of take on this Lightspeed and very Davis helped us really, who's an outside consultant to CPS, he was actually my college baseball coach, he kind of I don't know, I would say, more or less, has stayed very close with me over the years. And he's probably been on our leadership console in the last three, four years, to CPS. And we had an exercise team building a strategy where we had voted on the name together. So we not only voted on our values, which was out of 100 words, we came up with CPS, which was collaboration, passion service. And that's, I think, four or five different meetings to come up with that. But we also said, Let's describe the system. What we're trying to do, we got we start with the people, right, we need the people, which is HR, right, we need the recruiting, then we got the products, and we went all the way. And so you know, you have a finance team, you have a service team, you have engineering, Field Services, all these things that we had to kind of break down and reinvent ourselves. And we are going every each and every quarter.

Nico Johnson  27:11  
Yeah, one of the things I'm really inspired by or a couple I'll point I'll highlight, as I'm listening to you, you're unafraid to let the winds be held at the team level, it's not about you, you're also willing to go outside of the organization and ask for help. The example of hiring Barry Davis is a great example of this, I find that the greatest leaders have coaches, the greatest athletes have coaches, the greatest producers have someone that holds them to a higher standard that gives them ideas around how to overcome an obstacle, how to work through a problem, not believing that you're gonna figure it out all on your own and having the humility to accept that, I think is great leadership. So kudos to you on that. But I think that the other thing that stands out to me about CPS, and this isn't a unique aspect, it's just something that I think needs to be highlighted. And I think that anybody listening to this, this trying to build their business would appreciate the fact that you've created a continuous learning culture. And you've created a culture that values collaboration. And that instills it as a system through this what you can refer to as the triangle offense, you sent me some great material that I hope someday you turn in to a blog post or even a LinkedIn post. Candidly, I think that you, I think that you have something else that is attributable to the dance sugars of the world. That is the willingness and ability to communicate, how you think about leadership in a way that is that is easily digestible. And that is that feels approachable. You feel approachable, because you are you're you're to me, like the any man, right? Like, you can't you rose up through the sales ranks, lots of folks can put themselves in your shoes, you don't always feel like you deserve to be GM, or the president. And so you're very different as I see you interacting with your team, to your team's Leadership and Skills, and you don't, you know, steal their ideas, but you borrow them because your job as a leader is to instill those great actions, those plays that you see running in the sales team into the into the service team, and to gel those together. So kudos on that that triangle offense, I think bears a little bit more underscore that I want to highlight which is this idea from basketball, that it's never one person play, right. What does that look like on the ground in real terms for CPS, this triangle offense, like give me an example that a customer would appreciate? Yeah,

Speaker 1  29:30  
that's a good point. So our Lightspeed and then which, you know, if you think about the Lightspeed as the process for the whole company, we actually try to bring the customer into lightspeed. We want our culture to be their culture, it's all one, you know, basically one partnership, because if they're feeling like it's a strong partnership, that, hey, we're gonna go, you know, in the end, we have to sell the product, right? We have to service the product and we have to make a profit. We happen to be doing that But better than we've ever done it. But it's mainly because of our partnership, relentless partnership, customer focus, to have to welcome them into that Lightspeed and almost help create a stronger Lightspeed based on their feedback. So it's their feedback that one play inside of Lightspeed is the triangle offense, we say, our team, we got to run the triangle offense. So if a customer calls, it's no secret, we've had a challenge. You know, one of the challenges we had, I think it was early days of the 600, volt, AC output string, inverters, multiple, multiple companies that have had the challenge we've had is, is, you know, we decided to lean in at that time, unlike when we were so small, in probably the early days, 2014, when we had 2015, when we had challenges, we spent a couple years to recover. At that time, we this this go around, we had to get in front of every customer really talk through when when, uh, when the phone rings, you know, we're not just saying, Oh, thank you for calling. And, you know, let me get back to a lot of companies make that mistake, we would bring an entire team approach. So that entire department would get involved, every one person usually, that won't get involved, say service engineering, they'd pull all the data, that you'd have sales that's working with customer directly the partnership side, you'd have engineering who helped with the design, or if something happened there, you know, you'd have finance if there was a fun, and I mean, you know, you could have 10 departments or you could have two, but it's usually never one, just working directly with one, one person. So it usually be, you know, a lot of times you think about one on one. And this is what's cool about this concept is one one is, is like we both could have good ideas, you and I right? Well, if we're running one direction, who's gonna hold us accountable, your idea might weigh more than mine, or vice versa. Right? So we need a third. Now usually, that triangle works really well, because you're moving like inside our company, we're running many triangles. At one time, as we're talking, we're running many triangles. And that moves you very fast. Lightspeed, we highlight the speed because it is about if you think back to McDonald's speedy system, it is about how fast we can get new products. Did you know that we've never missed a shipment, since I've been here, we've never missed a shipment. And it's because we bring the products to the you know, we think utility scale will disrupt the industry because we can cut the lead times in half, or even probably, like more aggressively than that. And it's because we've never missed this four to six week lead time, which we say in string inverters. And now bringing the balanced system. It's, it's a lot of fun.

Nico Johnson  32:39  
I've heard you say something that I know is probably like written on the on the, on the computers, if not on the walls at CPS. And I want you to explain this mantra slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

Speaker 1  32:48  
So slow, is smooth, smooth is fast, is kind of not our saying it's some, it's something that you know, certainly was somebody else's idea. We kind of live it inside the company, because it's more like if we add a new person, and they're starting in the first 90 days, or even first six months, and they try to come in and move very quick and change a bunch of things, then you're kind of all moving chaotic and fast. So we try to come in with them slow and steady, and give them a little bit more responsibility, take on more, take those ideas into account and just go nice and smooth. It's never smooth, and it always is chaotic. But you're kind of always trying to chase that mentality.

Nico Johnson  33:28  
One of the things that I find you've probably had to fight internally a lot is that change has really stood gem power system, CPS has really stood for three phase string inverters. So talk to me about something that I'm sure your customers ask themselves a lot. Can string inverters really be used for every kind of project? But yeah, sure, it makes sense for C and I, but I hear and see CPS growing to 100 plus employees and growing to a product catalog that that suggests a move into utility scale.

Speaker 1  34:02  
So we feel that string could be used on every solar project in the US any size, we say from two megawatts to two gigawatts. Yeah. Because for us, why not add a solar project to us as a solar project? You know, you could have one larger machine, one megawatt project, or you could have multiple redundant machines that allow that one failure to not wipe out the entire array. That at the basic level, is why we feel string went out three, five years from now certainly 10 years from now, as the go to technology from two megawatt project standalone to a two gigawatt project. It's really probably 200 kilowatt to two gigawatt project. And that's because of the efficiency and like if you if you're if you're shipping, say 500 units to a project, right, and once one unit goes down, think about your uptime. You're still up and running. Rarely, if ever have I seen more? In one unit go down unless there's something happening at the plant level, whereas a central, you know, a larger, you know, incumbent technology for US market, you'd be losing a larger part of that right now we have projects being designed with CPS, our main product now is the 350. The 350 kilowatt has been designed in 200 megawatt plus projects, some even that's incredible double that size. So I think it's hard to know when designs and interconnects from say three years ago, Nika will flush out to say that now we're designing a solar project 100% of solar projects are being designed now because there's all these different stages. So I think that's what slowed down. We had the pandemic and, you know, just interconnect queues that slow down the adoption of string for the US, in Europe, in Asia, there string is the main technology being used. So we think we think it's coming. And we we hope we're the brand of choice

Nico Johnson  35:54  
makes a lot of sense when you think about the fact that the way that trackers were deployed a decade ago, if you think if you look at sort of ATI technology, it was ganged on one motor, and next trekker, and others disrupted that market with individual actuators. And in many ways that was that was Ray tracker was the original to introduce individual actuators, right? And people questioned that. And it was not dissimilar to power one saying, Well, why shouldn't we have we've got rack data centers, and you've got, you know, rack storage and data centers, rather than one central storage unit and ABB and others latched on to that CPS is the clear winner in the argument right now that in the QC, CPS is clearly the winner in the argument that three phase string inverters work for commercial and industrial. And it seems to me that that that architecture would scale as well. Sounds to me, like you're saying that the biggest hurdle to shaking out so to speak, the central inverter design, architecture is simply the design path of the timeline that it takes to get these product projects approved in the interconnection queue.

Speaker 1  37:04  
Yeah, cuz I mean, we launched the 250 to 75 800 volt machine, which was our first true utility scale machine in end of 2021. But But throughout 2022, those projects were being built or already designed, it's even went into 2023. This is the first year we're seeing a lot of kind of greenfield development. And every I would say every solar project is considering string right now, just three years ago, I would say half utility scale when even consider string. So it's really up to companies like ours to kind of convert, I think the number one to really simplify though, I think the number one reason that the business will all move to string versus central in the future is mainly on our side of the business. Right on our side of the business is the cost of service, right? It's the percentage of revenue that we watch, and how you can do a ship and replace versus, you know, every time you got to go out and deploy your own party to do the preventative maintenance and keep those machines up and running and larger components right? Large.

Nico Johnson  38:10  
Yeah, that's fascinating. I'd probably worth a follow up conversation, because I think you're onto something here around the relative maintenance. The Oh nm is worth studying around Central versus string inverters. I'm sure there's data that you all have to share. The other thing that I mentioned that I we did interview with you and your team in Boston back in February, is the storage infrastructure. It seems every inverter manufacturer today has their version of storage infrastructure, how to introduce that new product line is also complicated. As we wrap here, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the implications of adding storage as a product line, and the opportunity that you see moving into the next three to five years as a power conditioning company with adding storage that to that product line.

Speaker 1  39:05  
It's a great question. It's definitely been a slow roll for us. Again, if you think about someone device, designing a utility scale battery project. Three years ago, CPS didn't even have a product two years ago, same thing a year ago, is really, who didn't have a product this time a year ago. So we're getting into those design discussions. Now. I'd say I'd say second half of the year, we'll start more deployment both in CNI and utility scale storage, and a lot more in the years to come. 25 and 26. So we're excited about that. I think, how do we think about it as a brand? It's one company, but certainly how we think about it as departments as part of the Lightspeed is different, right? And that's something as we start to deploy the technology. We don't really think too much ahead. If that makes sense. We like to run the plays on the field. Another analogy We use is if you think about any baseball guy, so baseball starting lineup, you have nine players, you know, you come in and you're kind of like, these are the nine players for the game, right? You make a lineup that might have changes day to day. Usually it's not always the same. That's how we think of storage. It's going to be our core team and our leadership that will carry that idea that was started a couple of years ago, into the next phase. But then on the field, we'll make the decisions based on how we improve the Lightspeed for that business.

Nico Johnson  40:28  
Is there anything in particular around the way that you're looking at or adapting storage for the string inverter world that is notable with regard to help folks are thinking about perhaps like a sungrow system? That's like a bolt on to a big central inverter?

Speaker 1  40:41  
Yeah, well, that's what's interesting about it is actually our battery container can work with a central hub. So that is an interesting way that folks will get to know us is in the string inverter world with battery container. And there's less complexity there with interconnects. Like modules, then then on the PCs side, we do make the PCs and we make the battery container. So we That's how we're different, we make the whole make the whole total solution, everything but to sell. So we're basically like an integrator that way, and I'd say We're different because we're not only approaching CNI, which is our big customer base, we're also approaching utility, which we're going into for for the string market. But we're also looking at like the hybrid market in residential or like single phase. So we we launched a product recently for that market, which is new for our company, but it's mostly to help develop that commercial following, if you will, in the hybrid space. So hybrid resi, or single phase will say three phase, and then the the larger utility scale batteries is going to be where we focus. It'll certainly

Nico Johnson  41:45  
be fascinating, Brian to see if what I perceive in some ways the Trojan horse of energy storage for you guys will in fact, pull you into more utility scale projects, I for one, believe that, it very likely will have spent a lot of time with the power conditioning OEMs in the enter in the in this space. I've watched in that time, the the battery sales teams, and the battery side of the business be the tail that wags the dog, so to speak, I won't name names, but the one notable central brand, their battery is doing, I think on the order of 5x in revenue, what their power conditioning team their inverter team is doing. And and that is a in stark contrast with you know, just two years ago. So I think that it's prescient, obviously, it's something that you guys have seen coming and slow, smooth, smooth is fast, are taking it in stride. And I concur having listened to the the sort of the argument, as it were, that it does seem as utility scale projects, in particular, work through their current design cue, the an interconnection hurdles, which it's virtually impossible for them to change once they've locked in, and then a connection and a connection approval being designed into projects. Not only are you opening a field for CPS, but numerous other manufacturers that are going to be sort of knocking on the doors of these developers. I think the CPS once again, is changing and challenging the way that developers and engineering teams think about the product architecture, and what's possible in the same way that all the way back in, I think 2008 or nine, the CPS team challenged the way that I thought about whether or not my 30 kilowatt system could have a wall mounted inverter. So in lots of ways, Brian, you've outlined here for us not just how to think about product iteration, but how to use a framework, like your Lightspeed system and the triangle offense how to borrow from sports analogies, and not only sports analogies, but other successful systems like Ray Kroc McDonald's system of speedy efficiency. So kudos to you and CPS team. I know that folks who are listening are probably already familiar with CPS, but if someone is so inclined and wants to reach out what's the best way for them to, to connect with you and also to learn more about CPS?

Speaker 1  44:17  
I'd say go to our website cin power systems.com is a good way to get a hold of us and we have a system there. We'll we'll get we'll get you routed to where you need. Help, we can help. But no, I appreciate you saying that, especially about the batteries. Because I think what we won't sacrifice is who we are how we got here. To go after the next shiny object. We got to we got to really go slow. Get to the next thing.

Nico Johnson  44:40  
I love that I'll link to the a lot of the things that we've talked about here on the episode today. And in particular, I'll wrap with one more time slow is smooth. Smooth is fast. If you're a leader out there trying to figure out how to get your company to the next level. Hopefully you are taking something away from this episode and Brian's example that you You don't have to come up with all the ideas borrowing. As the as the artists you can steal like an artist, as they say borrow from the best and apply it to your team, your business. And hopefully you will experience the kind of not just growth but market dominance that Brian in the CPS team have experienced them impressed and inspired by the fact that not only were you able to come back from the relative the kind of fall from grace, as it were not being the dominant market player, but you have cemented more than just market dominance. But market transformation that concept that string inverter, three phase string inverter can be utilized across more than just a commercial rooftop project. I wish you all the best and success. Brian, thank you for everything that you do for the industry. Thank you for the leadership that you exhibit in the in the solar space. Yeah,

Speaker 1  45:48  
thank you, Nico, thank you for all you do. And look forward to your petty, more successful episodes. Appreciate you doing it.
