the built environment will incorporate renewable power on every structure that can support it. Our chief technology officer that we both really appreciate so much then Damiani says often, we did not leave the stone age because we ran out of stone, there's a better technology, and we can do this better. Hey, welcome

Nico Johnson  0:17  
back solar warriors welcome in. If you're new here, I just want to say thank you for lending us your ears. And the only non renewable resource that you've got. That of course, is your time. I'm alive. Once again, I'm always excited to be live each week we dig in here on SunCast. With entrepreneurs on the frontlines of the Clean Energy Transition, helping you build your business and your career, find meaning in your work and leave a legacy that you're proud of today's entrepreneur, Michael chanin is the CEO and founder of Cherry Street energy. And if you've never heard of the name, Cherry Street energy, not only are you not alone, because there was a time when I had not heard of Cherry Street and was referred by a good friend, and mutual mutual colleague, Bill Nessie. But I promise that you will hear more about them, mainly because of the way that they're approaching the concept of clean energy, renewable power as a product, and helping municipalities see the initial vision of Cherry Street energy is to build a renewable power company that can drive and the inevitable energy transition to a low carbon future. And as a result, Cherry Street now serves as Georgia's foremost non utility provider of renewable power, how they achieved that, and why as part of this conversation, from Savannah to Seattle, Cherry Street has helped launched three additional businesses, building out diverse companies to support the mission to produce and sell renewable power that is free of emissions predictably priced, and available to municipalities, institutes of education, nonprofits, and of course, businesses across Georgia and the greater southeastern United States. Michael chanin arrived at the vision for Cherry Street. In a prior iteration of his career, we'll talk about that the influence of his hometown of Macon his vision for the evolution of how clean energy can can in fact evolve at a municipal level, will no doubt captivate you as it did me. So sit tight. It's a fascinating career and entrepreneur journey that I know you're going to appreciate. Also, as a result, hope that you will subscribe to the show, because that's how you will ensure that you won't miss out on our twice weekly content just like this conversations with founders on the front lines, tackling the problems of our time, head on in precise, unique, innovative, creative, capitalistic ways. I know that's something that we'll talk a lot about today. Of course, there's more than 700 other founders stores the front lines over my suncast.com. But for now, I want you to get ready to tune up your skill solar warrior as we turn into another powerful conversation here on SunCast. Michael, I'm really excited that we finally had a chance to meet here in person in Atlanta, I wish he could have been making on Cherry Street in due time in due time. Yeah. So there is a feel like there's so much that we could cover every time I have a conversation with you. I feel like another layer of a very complex and delightful onion is is unfun packaged for me. But for those who are just getting familiar with the work that you're doing, at a 30,000 foot level, how do you describe to folks that are unfamiliar the problem that you set out to solve?

Speaker 1  3:50  
Sure street energy is a power company. And the problem initially, that I and now we and the team looks to solve is this inevitable transition that you cover multiple times a week, deep, insightful content. To inform everyone and all of us working on this problem. We're going to transition into a world the built environment will incorporate renewable power on every structure that can support it. the built environment will incorporate renewable power on every structure that can support it. Our chief technology officer that we both really appreciate so much. Then Damiani says often, we did not leave the stone age because we ran out of stone. There's a better technology and we can do this better. Now how we do it becomes complicated. There's regulatory, there's policy. There's incumbents that are shifting. Academically, the question we try to answer is what is the right way? What's the just way? What's the accurate way? How do we envision a power company? We say of Now initially it was a power company of the future. Yeah, that was just the power company. We sell electric municipalities, universities, schools, hospitals, major icons in our society, have made commitments 18 fortune 500 companies in Georgia all of them have some version of a plan to say we're going to address this, then the question is how? Yeah, the macro question we look to solve is to how we know we're going to do it, how are we going to do it, there's going to be a company a layer in the economy that provides this element power, yeah, that everybody needs. But we have to do so with humility. Because we're really just that element. We provide this foundational layer, all of our customers didn't go and use that power to deliver their product, we've got to make sure we elevate them, to let them know how they're going to achieve this transition.

Nico Johnson  5:50  
Yeah, you've chosen a historically very challenging segment of the market. And a lot of folks talk about the complexities involved in the retail side of the business, traditionally handled through power purchase agreements, private contracts that are hard to finance came out of the banking industry, which I know we'll get into in a little bit, but introduce us a bit to Cherry Street as a vehicle for doing something different than the, I'd say, much easier to finance traditional power model. At the wholesale market level.

Speaker 1  6:33  
Yeah, you've got a 100 acre, you know, when you start maybe 100 acre, now it's 1000 acre solar field that one might look at, it's easier for capital markets to get comfortable with it. Yeah, one off taker utility, that's investment grade, one location and all of the documentation, the problem we look to solve is, for customers, the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, Emery University, diverse portfolios, every building is bespoke. And they've said across all of them, we would like to incorporate renewable power to design, construct, operate, maintain with time and prove that infrastructure is the service for our customers, we then look to, as we say, Make Simple with sunshine, we needed to take out all of the complexity. The customer is used to on the retail side purchasing electricity. Yeah, we're just providing at a competitive cost, meeting their sustainability goals. And obviously, with no capital expense, is the customer then experiences that transition, they receive a better technology better power, that has predictability in ways that they've not had, historically. And so for us, the market based challenges are the managers to limits the How can I get the largest the fastest, it's large fields, right? We're trying to build 100 year business. So the question we ask is just fundamentally different. What does it look like 100 years from now? And can we make the best decisions we can today? To try to inform both the acceleration of the curve and the longevity, the sustainability of the business model? Yeah, right. We're working on something larger than ourselves, it's going to require collaboration. And it's going to require a lot of partners. We'll talk later about our shine on program workforce development that we do. But as we think about owning and operating and maintaining this distributed generation, power plant, and you know, in time, if it picks up on it, we're going to solve first the power infrastructure. And then we're going to work on rail in our offices right next to these train tracks, which have really wealth we just moved here two weeks ago, and it's, it's a neat spot right? In Midtown Atlanta, where one mile from Georgia Tech's campus we've got to hire. So many in his I hope, some of the avenues that we have for your platform is letting people know, we want to attract others, to this cause to this mission to do good and do well. Because for our customer, when I sit down with the mayor, it's like why, why am I doing this with you? I can just pay for it. Well, you could it gets complicated for tax credits and all of these other pieces, but it's an alignment of incentives. Yes. And saying who did the solar at Fire Station 17 with the grant rahega. And now we've got to go and do something with that. Our goal is to make operationally that seamless for our customers. There's another county, that's a customer of ours, and they had some in the sustainability team that had a bias for wanting to do it themselves. So we're going to internalize these capabilities in our team went and sat down. And the woman who headed organizationally these different pieces, asked us that our team did some research. It appears you have 18 electricians on your team. Are they the ones that are going to install this and work on this equipment after we provide designs on an ongoing basis? She says 18 We have one in his seven In the municipalities we work with the universities we work with the corporations we work with, are not staffed in such a way to manage power equipment. It's just not how the Marketplace existed. And so the underlying thesis that we have is that there's going to be someone that needs to service that customer base that. Early on in starting this as we were first I'd kept my day job. My background was in banking, I was a credit underwriter, a professional box checker by training. And I had started the business. And when I received commercial success, the model as it were, we could tell the unit economics war yield that we needed to generate from these cashflow, generating assets and went to raise capital. And our lead investor, one of the first meetings that I took, continues to be a board member, a gentleman called David Radcliffe, he was the chairman and chief executive of the Southern Company before his retirement, the regional utility in our market. And similar to how we started today, a kickoff meeting, and really just for advice, it was not an investor pitch. Because someone says, I know someone that ran a power company you could speak to and so he says, Tell me, tell me what you're up to. And I said, Well, I started a power company. And he laughed, and I said, I hope I've not offended. We have no interest in being antagonistic. Yeah, tility. We work hard on collaboration. And he goes, No, no, no, no offense taken. I just been doing this a long time. Nobody's ever said that to me before. And what's been interesting is we think of the energy services that we provide, we focus on on site generation, we have some small scale, utility solar programs that serves the distribution system. But we really focus on addressing the customer's load at the point of consumption is we think about building out that infrastructure into us the differentiation that we see in the marketplace, from where most activity occurs today. I mean, certainly, nationally, and it seems even what people focus on in the southeast, is more towards community solar, or on our very large scale, utility solar, and there's absolutely going to be a place for that in the overall energy mix. For us, our focus has not been there, it's been taking a longer view of trying to solve the more cumbersome problem, how do we address the built environment distributed for the commercial and industrial sector?

Nico Johnson  12:35  
It's interesting, it does for me represent the last bastion for distributed resources distributed energy, principally because the Counterparty is hard to underwrite. Capital isn't rushing in, because kind of hard is hard to underwrite. Aggregation, ie lead generation, much more complex, not not many are, are rated, it's not as easy to get the business equivalent of a FICO score, certainly without any rate, actually interacting with the company and asking them to provide you some you didn't know which

Speaker 1  13:09  
we do not. Yeah, we don't ask for customer financials, we understand the marketplace, in in some sense does. But again, this is 100 year view, the built environment will incorporate renewable power on every structure that can support it at scale. And we have to manage through this, you can't just jump off and say we're going to be at the full spectrum of risk. Capital Markets have solved that commercial mortgages exist as a product class, right? We were early on and I've you know, I've lacked diplomatic response or approach in some of those more heated negotiations with ultimately, lenders who don't understand the vision or the market that we're serving and addressing. And we have a 700 Kw project with a commercial office building. Not a great time for the commercial office sector in this facility, probably at some point is going to be impacted, it will change hands was talking to the lender that has a mortgage on this commercial property. And we have our assets that are there and they receive some protection, some structural property rights that we get in our power purchase agreements. And the lender says we would we would never allow that to happen. And I slid the sheet of paper across the table and said you already have Yeah, you have a meaningful mortgage on that property. We have a miniscule capital relative of our assets there. And we prime yours slightly technical jargon, but it was to say we have less risk than you do on that mortgage for getting a return of capital. And so I think ultimately, and we've been so fortunate both with our current majority, owner and primary investor as well as the Debt Capital Markets that support our growth, do they understand the model, they understand how we're thinking about this segment, this asset class. And it truly allowed us to get hundreds of millions of dollars of capital market support, financing this infrastructure for us is created some differentiation in the marketplace, because there's a threshold of solvency. And that was necessary to get to to really vertically integrate, I'd like to

Nico Johnson  15:27  
talk a bit about what it takes to begin to capitalize a business like this. And in some ways, it can be a chicken and egg, I do want to reserve the opportunity to kind of go through the how the business came into being. But if we can take a I want to look at how you structured what eventually became sort of our call the cornerstone of the of the thesis the business that you are able to finance and move forward, what is given you the bulk of the project portfolio, and that is the municipal deal that you have here with the city of Atlanta. I'd love to understand your approach to that opportunity, why it made sense to begin to anchor your portfolio around and then how you raise capital, in anticipation of and then as a result of that deal, totally.

Speaker 1  16:22  
Our board meetings coming up in two weeks. And so I'm working on our investor letter and the lead of this one is does the model work? It was the really early question that my dad needed dads and best friends to tell you're an idiot repeatedly. And does the model work? Was this recurring question? Are you right? On the unit economics, right? People have a vested interest in making things seem more complicated than right or what banks do is not complicated. banks lend money to businesses with long term contracts in predictable and recurring cash flow streams. The core operating model that we have is a long term contract a power purchase agreement at a fixed price. It's not flat 20 to 30 year agreement for our customer in these cases, municipalities like Atlanta. And so the unit economics was for a million dollars of infrastructure. We wanted to generate $100,000 of revenue. Yeah, 10% cash on cash. And that was it was unlevered. It was before the tax credit, we need to build a model that works just on those fundamental on the fundamentals. If it's a if it's a million dollars or so if it's a megawatt and it cost us $1.50 A watt. If it's a million and a half dollars, what do I need to charge my to get to $100,000 worth of revenue? 10 cents a kilowatt hour? Right, the sun shines in Atlanta, 1450 hours, a megawatt $1.50 per watt and a million and a half dollars. The sun shines 1450 hours in the year. Yeah, if you shine it on it, you're gonna get $100,000 of revenue. Yeah. Or what we would call project EBIT da because, as you know, we have an incredible own M team and is fortunately you heard a great and close friend of ours say we care deeply about the install quality, the performance and our own M team crushes it. For investor meetings, I would usually say it's a guy with a garden hose twice a year. It's more than that. But it's not a lot, right? It's not too dissimilar from software. It's about a 90% gross profit business. Once you get the asset in place, if you build it the right way, choose the right equipment. And take it we call that the Cherry Street standard. The Cherry Street standard is to say our power plants should perform as we anticipate if we do all the things that we're supposed to do. And so that 10% cash on cash yield gives transparency to our customers. It's how we work with them to decide Porsche cars. North America is a customer of ours. Same model, they wanted architecturally interesting walkways. They're beautiful, but they cost more, right. That's not 10 cents a kilowatt hour. But on a broad portfolio and weighted averages. They can be that type of transparency and predictability for our customers has been great. Yeah for how we can set it and so the city of Atlanta actually was our second customer. The first was my hometown of Macon. Yeah, Atlanta, in a woman called Stephanie Stuckey had worked hard on the enabling legislation that opened up the marketplace for third party ownership in Atlanta has bold goals by 2035 100% of Atlanta's consumption. They'd like to come from real power. Then it gets to the how, with what capital with what budget right and so for us, we can work with the city on just that. Let us help you meet that goal. And also, again, we'll come back to our shine own program. But let's address equity and inclusion and sharing this capital, what you need to have a partner at the platform layer that can own and operate these distributed generation assets consistently, to make sure that there's that repeatable benefit at all of the locations that they choose. Atlanta. The first installation that we did was a recreation center. I'll show you some photos of it so that we can have maybe, for others to see. But these were, on average about 250 kilowatt installation, right. At that point in time, we were not vertically integrated. And we still work broadly with EPC partners in a lot of different areas that we address. And we had a wonderful EPC partner at that point in time with the city of Atlanta on 17 projects. It was contracted for 20 years, who was getting a city to sign a contract they'd never had before. And then was it an art without framework? It was Yeah. So we did an RFP, and from there went to banks, the initial set 17 facilities was like $2.4 million. Plus, we had done one small system in Macon, which got our first bank facility was two and a half million dollars. Getting a community bank to lend to an asset class never went to a local community like local community. Yeah, it was so good. And this is, you know, the benefit and privilege of small communities, perhaps someone that that knew and felt comfortable, practically, and those that are technically deep in some of the details of this type of stuff. There are two elements in debt capital, that are necessary for our asset class that banks do not typically permit one is an agreement to forbear through the recapture period for the tax credit. And two is it can't be guaranteed, I can't personally guarantee or else the tax basis wouldn't be there,

Nico Johnson  22:06  
right? What does it mean to forbear

Speaker 1  22:08  
when a bank reserves their rights in the event of a default, and says, Hey, we're going to come and take this asset, because you've not paid us for the money that you borrowed. The bank can take it, it's part of the loan document. They agree ahead of time. Even if you don't pay us, we will not take control of this asset, because the tax credit would be recaptured. So we raised capital from other investors for another piece of the capitalization, this tax equity. It was a Bush administration tax credit on the second Bush administration, the investment tax credit that enabled at the time a 30% tax credit, if the bank in a default scenario Cherry Street hadn't paid took it, the tax credit would be taken away, and no tax equity investor would ever invest in that right and so getting a bank to lend to something they'd not it it's things like lending policy guidelines have to be amended, or at least it here to an acknowledged those steps. First there then we had a slightly larger facilities we expanded then Fifth Third Bank stepped in and allowed us more and now we've got a broader syndication of banks that support these types of assets. But at each stage, helping them understand initially investment grade counterparty like the city of Atlanta, or Macon, or even Emory banks can get comfortable with like, hey, you've got a 20 year agreement. But then breweries come in or low income housing comes in. Commercial Real Estate comes in. One of the things that we were able to do and structurally differentiated us in pooling our collateral was also structuring it so that our customers could come back year after year without having to have a new contract again, keeping it simple with sunshine for the customer. Yeah, they wanted another building. The city of Atlanta has 600 buildings. I don't know we're on several dozen of them today. Go into a couple of months. A couple of installations with them a month Hartsfield Jackson airport, the water treatment facilities, recreation centers, fire stations, Macon has 128 facilities. Savannah, we're on a few dozen facilities. Now. Chatham County, so municipalities realize the benefit of this. And then it once we had that core and the capital base to see, the predictability has been helpful. That's what banks like lending to. And as they would say, this is good risk. It is lending to an asset class with a predictable and recurring cash flow stream and so full circle for you know, Dad's question of does the model work now a decade and we've been so fortunate to be able to show that the model works, we're able to support our team to grow the team to to service, the debt facilities, which typically pay off after about seven years, and then use the cash flow generation from these assets to reinvest and continue to grow.

Nico Johnson  25:13  
Beyond friends and family, how did you capitalize the first in 2015? To get to the first project for the city of Macon, how'd you capitalize the business? Yes.

Speaker 1  25:23  
So that was putting all of my life savings into an idea. And so those were these great pieces to have. And again, in moments of privilege, just an incredible backboard and an overwhelmingly supportive and trusting wife that said, yeah, that seems like a great idea, Amanda, my wife did our logo, all of our marketing materials, the name Cherry Street, because the sun names as you know, can get confusing they are or overlap. Every town feels to have a Cherry Street. And it was a hometown, we want to be citizens and all of the communities that we serve, there's actually on Georgia Tech's campus at Cherry Street. And a lot of times, people from campus will say, like, oh, well, you're founded there. And it's like, but we could have been, yeah, which was totally to the idea.

Nico Johnson  26:10  
And that's right here reminds me of the Pecan Street Project from Austin. Uh huh.

Speaker 1  26:14  
Yeah, totally. I think we found that it resonates in how we offer it and what we do. And the team's really rallied around this idea of the Cherry Street power plant in the cherries treat standard, being a quality measure, not only in the quality of the infrastructure, but the quality of the people, how we treat our customers, to have forever customers. And I guess that's the other piece that we see a lot in our service to the customer base that we work to develop. And you know this better than I do, but there's a lot of different types of quote unquote, solar businesses. Yeah. And then there are a lot of different sales methodologies and offerings that just create confusion. And so for us, we've tried to be consistently simple as sunshine of, here's what we offer, here's how you can do it. You don't have to contemplate these other things, and tried to set up a model that fully aligned our incentives with our customers. I'm

Nico Johnson  27:20  
fascinated by the reality that you built a business that from 2015 to 2023. Had no outside sales. Yeah, you hired your first outside salesperson at the beginning of 2023, just barely a year ago. How did you go from 17? Buildings, the first RFP, to 600, effectively, no one else can build solar for the city of Atlanta and this as one example, because ideally, the way that you think about that is the model that takes you to other municipality. So how do you go from winning that first RFP to essentially controlling locking up in, in a sole source mechanism? An entire city, I

Speaker 1  28:05  
love history, as you know. And I've tried to go back and find some of the early sales tax for cell phones.

Nico Johnson  28:12  
When love where this is going.

Speaker 1  28:17  
When a city signs up for an Internet service provider, or a cell provider, they don't do it based off of each new desk that someone plugs in. Now. They're like, Hey, we got a new employee, they're coming in, can we go out to bid again, for their cell? When they have a utility service for electricity, or like if you've moved towns before, you just get handed this sheet of paper? And it's like, here's how you call for your electricity, right? Here's the call for whatever, and the model is the same. It's not intuitive to me, why necessarily, I understand why it developed the way it did. But it doesn't necessarily make it right, that there was going to say, Hey, you're gonna have a different provider of this at every one of your facilities, right? H fac doesn't work that way. And so I don't know, typically not I mean, I might have a couple of different vendors, as a city for who could service your H fac, maybe.

Nico Johnson  29:14  
In even certainly you wouldn't want to call 15 or 20, different roofing companies each time, it's

Speaker 1  29:18  
just not how now slightly different than ours. This is a capital market sort of implicitly requires that we have long tender contracts, and contracts. And otherwise, cities might say, Hey, we're gonna bid for the next five years or so that part perhaps different. But the construct of hey, you've had a service provider, take this renewable power service for you. We should just be the one that does it on all of them to ensure consistency and quality and that predictability. So that element that we established, I think was the buy in that we needed to get now we call our framework agreements don't mandate it I mean, they potentially could choose in in some instances, actually, they have there have been early on a couple of municipalities that got a grant. And then had somebody else do that. The downside, honestly, for us, the grant facility for this municipality had a thermal event. Yeah, not good. And we'd asked, Hey, can we go check it? Can we verify it? Hands off, it's, we've we've got this. Yeah. As soon as that happened, other stakeholders for this municipality said, hey, it's out. It's like, you could spend a lot of time saying no, no, that one is not the liars. That was the one out of you know, all of these others. This occurred with and so for us, we really try now, even if there are outside ones done, right, that we can help enforce the Cherry Street standard. And in our own em team and our monitoring capabilities are put on those Yeah, so we can make sure that there's quality consistency across them. And so we find now that sometimes customers will say, and there's a few instances with huge balance sheet corporates that say we really just want to own this one and sign a long term OEM agreement. Most often that doesn't happen. That's not what large corporates, right and even, you see, like the headline writes itself, like a return to profitability focus on core operations, like they're not building power plants. And so our model is by far, the most capital efficient way to incorporate renewable power, right. And increasingly, now we find that it's just the most efficient way, right? So once you sort of chin that bar of we can create the comforts of family in life for affording ourselves the opportunities that our parents were taught to forge for us, you were talking about sort of the rigor that your father might have suggested of like, how do you the way that I my throwaway line for that is new dads and best friends to tell us where idiots repeatedly, it's like, you've got a great job at a bank, what do you want to do invest in your life savings in something and taking the risk of doing these other pieces. And I used to say to folks, twofold there weren't a ton of days that I went to the office, you know, like pumping the fist, I created liquidity in the capital markets made it a better place today. Yep. The other is this idea that we could do good and do well. That I could effectuate change that I could make it better, you know, you asked him the the right of whether we call it in faith traditions or belief systems, or however we position ourselves to have mission and purpose, it was that I potentially had capacity to not just make myself available to contribute and contribute to my family, I could contribute to something that was greater than myself, and I could leave it better than I found it. And having that ability is really the wake up every day with a fire type of focus is why, you know, this lack of cocktail chat develops is to say, I think of these things because it it's ingrained in me of we wake up with purpose I can, I can make it better, I can help. And I can help our team, I can help grow a team, I can help give individuals purpose and how they contribute. And then we realize that we can do so outside of just our organization, our firm, we can help other firms succeed and do better. And then we can serve our customers. I mean, this idea that we're elevating and lifting up our customers, helping them achieve their goals. We have these incredible partners and customers that say we want to not only incorporate sustainability in our mission, but we have these major goals of equity and inclusion. How can we create a diverse workforce? How can we get the benefits of the renewable energy economy to shine on everyone? Yeah. And that was our shine on program. Yeah, we can help others. We can help them start firms. And ultimately, we can take away some of the greatest challenges that they have in starting a business as an entrepreneur, we can give

Nico Johnson  34:39  
their being folks with less resources we can give backlog absolutely there tell me the genesis of shine on. So

Speaker 1  34:48  
the real genesis of shine on is that and rightly people call it the Atlanta way but practically what the Atlanta way means is that we are an inclusive community in Atlanta. Oftentimes by law Ah, de rigueur, but I mean, it is a requirement of RFPs that we have minority and disadvantaged business enterprises that are a part of what we do. Yeah. What drove me nuts. And this gets back to my Macon Georgia days, the center of my universe, is it? When I looked at what the rules were, you recognize that it's honestly a racket, and you can pay an African American man at the supply house to buy your equipment. Yeah. And that counts? Yeah, it's like, oh, well, I spent 35% of our overall, the first two and a half million dollars $2.4 million. We could just bought everything from a guy paid him 5% In that counts. That's not what it's about. Like, that's not, that's not the purpose of those requirements. We weren't going to do it that way. And ultimately, in our industry, we're gonna have a meaningful in what we do as a country, workforce shortfall. And so we've got to find an opportunity to to train those individuals. And so the shine on program was what we call a reimagined renewable energy economy, from blue collar to new collar. Let's help those who would like to participate in software as an entrepreneur, the hardest part sales, we've got sales, we've had a backlog of opportunity, we need to value work, we need to talk about the virtue of hard work. And that's why we built solar school. That's why we created an apprenticeship program in 2018. I mean, this is well, before, you know, there were tax incentives to do so. It was the right thing to do. And we've talked before about what's a five year goal or a 10 year goal, or how do you measure success? I think investors don't like the answer. But say like, how do you Where are you in five years? It's like working hard. We're building 100 year business. Yeah, if you focus on 100, your business, the decisions that we make are different. Yeah. And that's where we've really spent the time. The element that we were talking about that ties us back together of workforce development, building this reimagined renewable energy economy, I've been fortunate enough, blessed enough, through the course of this to meet individuals like our Chief Technology Officer, Ben Damiani, who, there to, you know, in my wind up doll moments of, you know, just telling telling the pitch again, and again, first that Lynn says I've said today is that we did not leave the stone age because we ran out of steam, right? Solar power is a technology, it's not a fuel. That's what causes this thesis that the built environment is going to incorporate it. I mean, we're so early, it's not going to all look like what's behind me. I mean, I'm going to adopt it into the built environment, so many different ways. We've been hit built major manufacturing of solar panels, the major manufacturing of solar panels that he built, was, as he would say, pushing a rope. The industry for 20 years, has been pushing a rope saying we have the best technology in earth, for the entrepreneurs, the solar warriors that you talk to, you know, my throwaway line, when I get asked like, what's the learning of years of after doing this? Being right, is necessary, not sufficient. Being right does not matter. We've been right about a lot of things. That's not what caused the adoption. That wasn't the next piece in so that's when Ben says we've been pushing for the last 20 years. And he joined Cherry Street like now I'm pulling, I'm bringing people to this thing, a couple of reasons. One, we take away all the capital

Nico Johnson  38:51  
expense so people can enter technological evaluation. Absolutely.

Speaker 1  38:54  
And so we solve those problems for them. But that to me is now this piece of this is how we can motivate folks to come along with us because now what we've got to focus on is executing now we've got to motivate people because it's a rote task. And like this is why like, you we talk about our swag or comfortable tees or he got in the field and everybody's got it too. But it's because people don't care. Even they at least don't invest in the right way. On skilled labor. Yeah, like, what does it look like? And we spend a lot of time on our construction operations of not only are you hydrated and do you have shade, but like, what are you wearing? What physically are you working on to make sure that you're safe? Are you stretching or lifting the right way if you taking the right OSHA exams? I'm not someone who'd had exposure in life before starting this business a lot necessarily to the skilled labor layer of the economy. And in starting it and working on a lot of construction jobs. In getting going, he was the first time that I'd ever sent people home or had to talk to a site supervisor to say y'all are done, like, pencils down, go.

Nico Johnson  40:11  
Because there's a heat or because if I'm going to

Speaker 1  40:13  
talk to someone on the job site and then be like, hey, yeah, how do you know, Bob? So I go, I was at Starbucks yesterday. This is a guy like with Deuce and a half, with the middle of July and he's wearing a long sleeve black T shirt and jeans, carrying 32 pound capstan cinder blocks on the roof. So everybody, how am I what are we doing? Like, that's not how we're gonna build in scale. And we're, again focused on 100 Your business we're going to do it the right way, are now we have HR and some other things. Our compliance training is slightly different. I used to just show Warren Buffett in 1992, testifying about some of the fraud that happened at Salomon Brothers, and he's like, I hope that when the klieg lights shine on me and we try to stay out of like doing this, I'm very excited about having the opportunity to be with you, and talk and hopefully help educate and inform your viewers of how achievable is having a bias towards just starting. But we've not done a lot of marketing. We've not put ourselves out there a lot. My view and I'm a literalist, when I think about people talking about the fabric of society, right. So klieg lights wherever to shine on me. We have above the fold aspirations, but for the right reason, and that, we hope that you asked the question before, and I get asked it a lot by shared friends of ours and bins to say, I don't understand Cherry Street, I don't understand their model, how are they actually making it? And are they actually making it? Or there's smoke and mirrors in there and what's doing it? We've always wanted the klieg lights when they shine on us to say they did it the right way. They were good to the people that they work with. Yeah. And those pieces are the 100 year decisions that we feel very comfortable at the bad interview question that you don't ask very often, but someone did ask me yesterday is like, what keeps you up at night? Like, worry about, like, I'm so fortunate, we have a rule on the team that you can not write me an email with urgent in the subject line, like urgent things exist in life? Yeah. Not very often on like, the accounting team. You know, there's urgency, but we just care about be kind and how we serve, those that we work with, on do it the right way, help build teams like our shine on teams. For that long term perspective. Yeah. And that, I think, is what's continued to differentiate us. In our marketplace, I'm sure. And this is why meeting folks like you is so helpful to me that there are others that are doing that, finding that connectivity to those others and helping them with that up because we really just focus on collaboration. We're competitive and people will win RFPs it hasn't happened yet. They might, and it's gonna, right. Someone's going to choose we've not watched an RFP in Georgia yet. It'll happen. And as it does, 2036 Yeah, of course, like, it's gonna be the next guy's problem. But like, and we'll blame him. I remember not finger pointer, but it'll definitely be that guy's fault. But right now, it's work hard. Be kind to those people around you. And do it the right way. Yeah. In that's not gotten us in trouble. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  43:35  
So there's a whole story that we need to tell about your left turn moment. But you're a Jewish kid raised in traditional south, well to do family, Macon, Georgia, who did not aspire to be a banker. And who ultimately ended up in northwestern studying American history and African American history specifically, could you talk about the motivations that drove you in your youth? And there's like two conversion moments that I think about right. One is you learning the capital market side of life, and the other is you realizing it, that's not where you wanted to spend the rest of your career, you know,

Speaker 1  44:19  
as a Jewish kid, and Macon, Georgia with 100 Jewish families. I appreciated that discrimination existed. Yeah. And I witnessed it a lot. Most often in Macon, targeting the black community, in a long legacy in the south, obviously, of you know, the country's Original Sin as it were. But then I had these great friends, that both were a bigot. and probably like, my dad has this line that, like, that guy is such an anti Semite. And he's like, Well, you don't know me. You know, it's like easier. He's toward someone else. Like, we were friends until he knew that, like I had this thing of difference. And so inequality in really inequality, structural inequality, racial inequality, institutional inequality. It didn't make sense to me in this I describe it sometimes as being like a naivety balloon in life, I just could, like, float through and not know and be like, oh, gosh, like, how could this person this person not like each other, just because of this thing that is uncontrollable, both uncontrollable and indeterminate, have the ultimate like, value or identity of that person. And it's like, you know, sometimes you go through the thing is like, Give me three adjectives that define you, father, husband, son. Now, if someone else gave those three adjectives about you, like they might, their one, two and three could have been your eight, nine and 10. Yeah. And understanding like how other people view that. And oftentimes in this is like a Jewish kid in Macon, Georgia can pass if someone else and then recognizing like, hey, they said something to me that had they known this about me, it wouldn't have said, and so that was the academic question that I went to college with it was to say, how does this exist? And what is the I like people's stories? Like I like the idea of narrative and in history of like, what, what makes you How did you get to this place where you are today. And so that's what I really studied, in college, understanding those types of inequality. And then from there, studied, so American studies history, and ultimately that that was African American Studies, because I focused on race in the south. And some wonderful professor said, if you think the American South is, you know, this unique story, you should reevaluate this global picture. And so then global human rights became this question that I pursued. In graduate school, I was at Cambridge, outside of London, and I was really focused on human rights in East Africa. Yeah. And I was gonna move there. And my father suggested, instead of a PhD, I should get a job, a real, real job, the real job. And this is the summer of 2007. Wow. And so in a bit of a shotgun approach, I had found out that a bank was interviewing, they were looking for someone that had an accounting and finance background, preferably that didn't interned at their bank or a bank before. And I wrote back to this guy that I had gone to college with and said, I have none of those qualifications. My father suggest I need a job. Can I come have an interview, and this was in like, November, it was in the fall. He did not write back. I got a note from him in March. It's like, hey, my boss was emptying out his inbox. He saw your resume, and we've still not hired for this role. And not someone. I was in London, when when's the next time you're gonna be home? It was like, next week, spring break. So great. We'll set up a time for you to come and interview with everybody. And so I interviewed at this bank that candidly and I recognized in retrospect, that it seems preposterous, but I think it's helpful to know, I had not heard of it. This this bank, it's called Goldman Sachs, and I think that they'd reach but

Nico Johnson  48:39  
you're 2122 Yeah, yeah. And

Speaker 1  48:43  
so it was just not part of my focus or thought me I just was not as probably crisis. This is pre global financial crisis went in like Goldman got in the limelight in ways then certainly. That were not glowing. Yeah. But it was before I'd seen it and hit that interview became that job. And that to me was this entree because initially I think that most maybe not fully appreciate Goldman in these new analysts class that globally at the time, were maybe 300 or so. Investment bankers they were going to train half of them had a liberal arts background. My first day of the training was the first time in my life that I'd seen Excel definitely Excel. Are you seriously into balance sheet? Yeah,

Nico Johnson  49:34  
I'd never mind God.

Speaker 1  49:36  
I had one stats class for distribution requirement.

Nico Johnson  49:39  
Fun fact that you told me last night what did they do on your first day on the job? Took the

Speaker 1  49:43  
mouse click your mouse? Yeah, mouse look is four seconds. Yeah. Yeah, times money.

Nico Johnson  49:48  
Wait. mouseclick is first. I don't think this is interesting and keystrokes less than one second. Yeah.

Speaker 1  49:53  
So over the course of the year, there are days that you could at first Any keystrokes as they see one making and so, kind

Nico Johnson  50:03  
of highlight before we keep going another like to your father and I seeming like unbelievable naivety. Who, who did you go to school with? And who did he later? Sort of? Introduce into your world? Yes.

Speaker 1  50:18  
So freshman year was twofold on this. And both of them they were in the same like organization and then they both interestingly like this, right? Like how life intertwines itself. How, because I saw this clip, in 2002 1006 is when I saw the clip at the annual meeting that we show for our components that I just mentioned to you. Yeah, I saw it and that's before YouTube because YouTube didn't happen yet. Right. So I saw that clip and it's ingrained in me like I saw this man at the beginning of the first the Goldman I got there. Because I live freshman year they call it the mole hole. All these guys in northwestern lived on this hallway and across the hall from me, as a guy from Phoenix, Arizona called Matt a thorn. In Matt's dad was a lawyer from Phoenix who in the late 90s, got involved and I think really became a leader in an organization of a solar firm called for solar. Yeah. And so because of that, I had a lot of familiarity from following Mike Hearn. In first solar's climb. That's amazing. And so I knew that story with Mike Aronson. Yeah, lived across the hall freshman year of college. And Matt was the one at Goldman who sent the email out to the listserv saying, I work at this bank that are ever heard of amazing. Yeah. And in college in the same group with Matt and I was this guy whose grandfather had this insurance business in Omaha. And his name is Warren Buffett, and they had a business, the insurance businesses, Berkshire Hathaway, yeah, in Berkshire Hathaway ultimately became an investor not only in first solar, but then a lot of these other businesses. That informed and basically the next five years of what my father was, he just was a PhD of here's how capital markets rank in the world. And

Nico Johnson  52:20  
the connection, the phone call that you made to your father, when you realize to Warren Buffett was

Speaker 1  52:25  
so mad, so my buddy in college, his name's we got him how he Buffett that might go by Howard Buffett now, Howard, Warren Buffett, and I called Dad and I said, Hey, my buddy, how we invited me to go to his grandfather's annual meeting. He's got an insurance business in Omaha, in my thesis was due the next week. And he's in my dad, you know, my dad's car that I would have driven right to Omaha. And he's like, no, no, you're not driving the car. You know, however, for it is the route from Chicago to Omaha, for some thing. Who is your buddy's grandfather? Like, what?

Nico Johnson  53:06  
What did best question your dad could have followed with? What are you talking about?

Speaker 1  53:10  
I was like, I don't know. He's got an insurance company. And his name is Warren Buffett. He says, Can you move the date that your thesis is due? No, they assigned the date that this is due in September, like there's no chance? Yes, like, well, you have to you have to go. You have.

Nico Johnson  53:24  
You hadn't. You've had no idea who Warren Buffett was? No, I just I mean, in fairness, I don't know that I would have either said 92. No later, it's just 2000. This is

Speaker 1  53:32  
2006. So this would have been the annual meeting. Warren Buffett, I just didn't I mean, I understood that. My friends.

Nico Johnson  53:41  
I just want to point out to folks that in 2006, less than 10 years from you starting the company, you neither knew Goldman Sachs, nor Warren Buffett existed. Yeah. You were in Cambridge, thinking about how to create more.

Speaker 1  53:56  
I was focused on human rights. It was gonna work in a Here's a helpful anecdote perhaps from my naivete, or like the genuineness with which I wanted to effectuate change, my dad. After leaving the clothing store worked, we recorded a stockbroker growing up private wealth or welfare. And he worked at Salomon Brothers, Salomon Smith Barney. That's how I knew and why the the quote the compliance quote from Salomon in 92 resonated so much with me. As someone that worked at the firm that was senior there, Jamie Dimon. At the time in 2006, was at Bank One in Chicago dad called to get me a meeting to go sit down with with Jamie. Yeah, okay. Um, and so I went in, sit down. He's like, so what are you here for thinking like, I want a job. It's like a bankers. Yeah. Like, what are you doing as a bank to help serve the community and help me he's like, What do you do? Like we have a nonprofit or I'm like, What are we what are we talking about? Like, why it was a Curtis who said Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like, why are you here? He's like, I can connect you those different pieces. I'm like, there's so much that we can do to give back. You've got an entire balance sheet you can contribute to help those. Yeah. And so I was very focused in the moment on how institutions and organizations could contribute more. Yeah. And where they served. And this gets back full circle to this idea that like, I wasn't doing good and doing well. I made the money. Certainly it's there. And it's relevant. It affords all of these great opportunities at Goldman didn't matter. Yeah. So you

Nico Johnson  55:38  
took the job at Goldman. Yeah. You How long were you there before? Yeah. Five years, five years. Describe for me, fried chicken Friday, crisis of conscience. memo to self left turn in life, September

Speaker 1  55:50  
18 2015. Now, in this again, I identity and Jewish identity come full circle. I'm a member of a club, my dad's love languages, golf. It was he he would have played professional golf it but they didn't pay for it in the 80s. He played at the University of Georgia. But He parlayed it into how he built his business, his book, how he connects with different people. And part of that was being a member of a private country club. And yeah, he was a member of a number of them. And through that, I knew I was moving to Atlanta, this is 2008 at this point. And he says, I want you to meet some folks and they say, Oh, of course. You have to join this club. So I joined a club. It's in Buckhead in Atlanta. Yeah. I'm working at Goldman. And I moved in, I'm still at Goldman. I moved to San Francisco. I come back affectively, five years later, and it's September of 2015. And I'm meeting this guy, it's a friend. And he's like, Hey, you're a member of this club. It's like, oh, well, you must know this other guy. Because he's also a member of that really? waspy club. Yeah, that's a Jew. It's like, well, we don't all know each other. And I didn't know him. But I'd love to. So go down and sit down with this lawyer, Ira, Jewish guy. And I'm talking to you about these different side hustles? Because I'd done the stuff with our friend Ben. Yeah, I had American efficient, which would become while in which become modern energy. And I'm telling him about that. And the capacity demand market and PJM. And this just like interesting stuff, because well, that's fascinating. Did you hear about House Bill 57? House Bill 57, the solar power free market financing act of 2015? No, I've not heard about this. That's a law that just changed in Georgia, allowing for private sales of electricity. Now, this happened in 2011. In New Jersey, yeah. When I was at Goldman, right? We had bank to business. When I started at Goldman, it was called a px. Yeah, they changed their name. And I don't know, nine or 10, to be Vivint to the they were residential alarm business. And we're in Utah. And then in 2011, the laws changed in New Jersey, and they said, Hey, we've got a lot of installed customers. In the desk. We were on it. Goldman had a tax equity component, and debt. And they said, Could we do solar, because look at the returns on solar, and almost overnight, Vivint became one of the most meaningful residential solar projects. So I'd seen what happened when that wall changed. I'm leaving fried chicken Friday, take a left turn out of the club, and I call first friend of ours who says, this is interesting, but I'm focused on something else. Yeah. And I remember where I'm sitting going down the road talking to my dad, and I said, Dad, I do not understand why I don't know the details yet. The law has changed in Georgia, and story for another time. But my grandfather was in the liquor business before he had the clothing store. And I'm like, Dad, it's like prohibition just ended in Georgia. It's like, you can put a gas tank behind everybody's house and sell them the electricity. And no one's here yet. You say, Well, let's go learn more. Yeah. And so that Monday, because I called the lawyer after that I had lunch with and I said, Hey, can I meet the lawyer that you said, he's like, Yeah, I'll set it up and said, My dad myself. This lawyer is called Stiva day who's still an adviser of ours, and he's wonderful for a laundry list of reasons. We get in the meeting and dad asked the first question, like, we have not sat down. He's like, Steve, who paid you? He's like, What do you mean I'm, I'm here as a courtesy, to this other partner to have this conversation with us. I know, who paid you to change the law. People don't just change the law. Yeah. It's like Robert, I'm Harvard Law class of 78, editor of an environmental law journal. I've cared about this my whole life. We changed the law in Georgia to Create a marketplace that didn't otherwise exist for kids like your son to start business. No shit. That was the fire I needed. I was like, let's go. Yeah. And that was it. And so I leave there. My wife makes the marketing materials. We formed the company had incredible support and a lot of different ways. I spent all nighters. I mean, I just and you say I've got a great memory, which I'm appreciative of, I don't but I've got a very good memory about our business. I mean, it is, I can see every day so vividly, because it's been so focused to say, this is coming. the built environment will incorporate renewable power on every structure that can support it. And all I see are rooftops. Our technology is better, it is inevitable. We're going to build a team to do it and achieve it. Let's go I called the mayor of my hometown, and I said Mayor Rickard, I got a business idea. This is October, about what said solar power. He says, Good. I'll bring my green team. December 9 of 2015. Amanda had made my wife the deck the logo, we put a pitch together. Five minutes into my first pitch. It's myself, my dad, the mayor, his Green Teams, a man called Sam kitchens. Mayor record companies like Michael, let me make sure I got this right. At no cost to the city, because you're gonna pay for it. You're gonna save us money, because your electricity less expensive than Georgia powers. And I get to stand on the front steps of City Hall with that photo man taking my picture telling everybody I go on green. What am I missing? Mayor fortunately, you've known me my whole life. Because it's a snake oil sale. No call save money go green. Yep. You used to drag race against dad on Eisenhower Parkway. I'm telling you. It's common. He says, Well, let's be first. So the first private sale of electricity in Georgia was put in Cherry Street energy, making Bibb County the sheriff's investigative center on third and Riverside. The contract is for the 128 facilities in Macon, Georgia 20 years from the date of the last installation, or improvement, because we're the energy provider to all of the facilities. Yeah. And then Stephanie stuck in Atlanta called and said, Hey, I saw what you did in making. We wanted to be first I worked with Steve O'Day on getting this legislation passed. So well, you can be second. Let's go. Yeah. So very soon after I in 2016, Atlanta caught and then Imran Khan said, Hey, we worked with Atlanta on their 2035 goals, we have the same commitments. That was our third. And I've gotten compliance approval with the bank. But for the first three years, I still have my day job. Yeah, hold on,

Nico Johnson  1:02:44  
we got all that you still got the Tailmon through all this. Now? What does success look like? You've said several times, this is 100 your business?

Speaker 1  1:02:58  
How do we measure success? The idea that I as an individual can work on something that's larger than myself effectuate change in the community, and help leave it better than I found it.

Nico Johnson  1:03:13  
How do you infuse that into the cultural fabric of the business?

Speaker 1  1:03:17  
infusing that in the business? I gave? I got nominated for something and you have to go and interview with some folks on things. They said tell me about the characteristics that you look for. Yeah. And I you would have heard me say a number of times kindness. Just be kind. In, in that piece of what we do. I've mentioned to you someone on our team who said to me that they were talking to someone that had such a strong opinion about something that they know so little. And we find that all the time and what we do what we infuse in the business, because we're gonna make mistakes, we're gonna be wrong. Own it. Often, I mean, early on, and my wife says it can't say anymore. But we only had one rule, which was Don't f it up. Yeah. And like those pieces are, you know, but now that can create anxiety for my husband. It's like, initially, it's just like, you know, it Facebook, they can go fast and break things right? In power, similar to healthcare, like you can't really go fast and break things. So like, let's learn, let's be patient. We take risks, but we don't take outsize risk and the type of things that we approach, the things that we try to infuse in the culture is if if you are curious, and if you're kind to those that you're working with, because we're asking customers do things I've not done before, and then working with each other. And candidly, especially with growth and scale, I mean, we don't have a ton of churn, but like we definitely do not permit people to stay here that don't really stand up to that measure or that test. It's like if someone goes into a meeting, dreading having to go into the meeting With that coworker, and then good, right? And so there are a lot of times that there's probably someone that is smarter or more capable it like the pure task. But it's the intangibles of are they showing up early? Are they leaving late are they committed and dedicated to the overall mission of what we're working on. And that surfaces itself. And so the way we phrase it oftentimes is making sure we've got the right people on the bus in the right seat, and actively making sure that we can help those people that are not in the right place, find the right place. And a lot of times that might not be here. And those are tough conversations to have. But honesty, really just surfacing that and clearly communicating with people has been how we try to approach a because I think a lot of times folks either hide the ball or try to silo those pieces.

Nico Johnson  1:05:53  
Well, there's so much more. I wish I could dig into. There'll be others, right? There will be I hope, so I expect so. And we've, we've captured some amazing footage of what will be a beautiful, the filling station of the future. But I think that we've also captured what I think is the essence of entrepreneurship. And I'm so inspired by the business that you have built, I'm sure that others watching are going to feel that as well. Some, no doubt will say that's the kind of place that I'd like to work, what would what would be the best way for folks to reach out to you if they either want to work here collaborate with you try to emulate your business in other places.

Speaker 1  1:06:38  
So we're hiring Yeah, be in touch. I'm Michael, at Cherry Street energy.com. The best way to contact us is through our website, Cherry street.com to collaborate for new technologies for people that are interested in hiring for a lot of people that are watching you, trying to learn how to incorporate renewable power and what that looks like. We do hope that there'll be in touch because one of the core pieces that we focus on is collaboration, we are working on something larger than ourselves. We're gonna need other partners, we need technology partners, we need installation partners, and we want to support others, helping them along the way as they try to achieve and serve a lot of the marketplace that we don't. Can I say it's in everybody's best interest to help each other in that endeavor? Because there are a number of examples of bad product in what we do is bad for everybody. Yeah. And so helping each other is absolutely going to make it better for her. And I would say in our ecosystem, that has generally been my experience. Yeah, we've got great collaborators, Michael,

Nico Johnson  1:07:51  
um, I'd like to leave on this one fairly simple question, what will have changed as a result of the work that you're doing, leading

Speaker 1  1:08:04  
our state or region, and in time, we believe a broader part of the country, in this inevitable transition, to incorporate renewable power is necessary and important, because of the work of our team. The focus on incorporating renewable power. We're focused on helping serve the system and our customers have reliable and affordable and clean electricity to do all of the things that make our communities thrive. We view electricity as a right. Yeah. And so a lot of times he will say, Michael, it seems like a sharp left from human rights to a renewable power company. And maybe it's because everything's linear, looking back, but it does not feel that one. Yeah. Energy is a right. It's why we created the utility monopolies, everyone so that everyone had access, equitable access to reliable power. Yeah. And so we're in a spot and we'll talk again, because in my home state of Georgia, we don't have enough electricity. We know this to be so yeah, it is an urgent call, to help serve the system to make sure that all of us have access to that. So as we continue to work on our mission, when people look back and say what did they accomplish from establishing this thing, we helped serve our communities with reliable access, to power to do all of the things that make our lives vibrant to give each of us joy. Michael

Nico Johnson  1:09:45  
chanin is the CEO and founder of Cherry Street energy. It has been one of the most enlightening, heartfelt conversations. I've had long time. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Thanks so much for making the time I'm glad you welcomed me into your, your world here, come

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03  
get involved.

Nico Johnson  1:10:03
