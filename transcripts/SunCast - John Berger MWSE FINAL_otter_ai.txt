John Berger  0:00  
We're headed towards a revolution, and what I mean by that is the technology is increasingly going to deliver cleaner, less expensive, more reliable power to consumers and the current regulatory structure, yes, I mean the utilities is standing in the way, but eventually what ends up happening is the consumers rise up, and they're also these consumers are called voters, and they get what they want, which is cheaper, more reliable, cleaner power,

Nico Johnson  0:30  
despite more capital coming into the industry than ever before, despite healthy unit economics, Rising utility rates, even declining equipment prices against all odds, equity and debt instruments across the industry are trading at what could handily be called distressed levels, and working capital is scarce. And you probably are asking yourself the same thing that I and John are asking ourselves, why is that? Well, we're going to talk about it. How long do you think it'll take before the tail winds actually come back to help us overcome the headwinds and see a recovery to help us really dig in to that quandary and conundrum of where we're at in the current market cycle. Is John Berger, this founder and CEO of Sonova since 2012 where he has served as the president and chairman of the board as well with more than two decades of experience in the energy markets like power extra electric power industry, John isn't true energy entrepreneur. He's someone that I've gotten to know over the last few years as not just Ernest and erstwhile but a true advocate. He is one of the few who very early in his career, was out front doing what we all believe is true. We need to be better storytellers. I would argue that John is probably three, five to one more in front, on in front of news outlets. I'm grateful that he gives us time at Suncast and here at Midwest solar as well, but he's always out talking to the news outlets. And for that, I really appreciate the work that John does, and I just want to give a big Chicago Welcome to John Berger. Hope you guys enjoy this conversation.

Unknown Speaker  2:16  
Thank you, Nico.

Nico Johnson  2:17  
So as I alluded to the elephant in the room right now is that we are in what could be called a market slump. Market slump that, you know, it rises, it raises the question, Where in the value chain do the real structural problems reside, and do we see a way out.

John Berger  2:42  
Yeah, you know, we were talking earlier and and I think that, you know, simply put, if you were to rewind the tape almost two years, exactly to the IRA announcement signing, given that that those happened fairly short order, within each other, and said that this is the condition of the industry. I think I don't think any of us would have predicted that. I certainly wouldn't have and yet, here we are. And so where are we? As you said in your opening comments, Nico, the fundamentals look pretty good, the unit economics. And what I mean by that is, can you sign up a customer for solar service, solar plus storage service, and make money doing it, and the customer saves money. So the customer has a value proposition. The customer has higher reliability of power. And everything you know, the in the value chain makes sense. And what I mean by that is the installer makes a margin and is making money. The equipment manufacturer is making a margin and making money. So everybody makes money, and there's a value proposition for the customer, savings and reliability. And the answer to that is, despite higher interest rates, the answer is yes, and part of that answer is, is that utility rates have skyrocketed, and in some cases, like California and other Wyoming and some other areas, it's, it's breathtaking, the percentages over the last, really, three years, but, but now starting to move into its fourth year. When you, when you look at this, you would say, well, then if you can make money on an individual basis with an individual customer and and you've got this backdrop of as to why you're making money, which is that the price to beat is going up now the equipment cost your input. Mean, if you're an equipment manufacturer, you could say, Well, I understand why some of the that those companies are struggling, but, but everybody else should be doing very well. And who's everybody else was a contractor, installer, the service provider, the finance here, like with us and our competitors, doing well. Then when you look at the equity markets and the debt markets and so forth, you don't, you don't see that sync up. And in fact, capital, as you mentioned, is. It has been constricted, whether it's from commercial banks giving working capital lines to contractors or equity prices. My equity price included, obviously, debt in the marketplace outside the asset level. So we have a deal in market right now on the securitization side. And I'd say, Can't make too many comments for a public company, but I'd say, not bad. I'll just leave it at that. So that's interesting. But the corporate debt market, as opposed to the rest of the corporate debt market, is horrible. So I think all this leads to is, like, what's going on here? I think it's really a malaise in the industry that there's a variety of issues we'll get into, I'm sure, and talk about, you know, the California utilities, and it's not just Nim 3.0 but the recent decisions and actions that were taken on the demand charges and so forth, some of the other areas, the domestic content just and it's prelim, right? It's not even finalized. Just came out on Thursday, almost two years later, so there's a lot of delay in the rollout of the IRA. And so there's a lot of different things that have gotten in the way. Obviously, the shock of rates moving higher wasn't helpful to the equity and debt markets and so forth. But there's a lot of reasons, but I don't think that those reasons, those negative issues, stay with us forever, the election outcome, what's it going to be? That's another thing that's near and dear, that it's around the corner. So all those things are here, and we'll leave it to later questions, but I do think that we'll come on the other side of this much stronger.

Nico Johnson  6:36  
Sonova was a strong proponent in the marketplace for a loan at a time when many of your competitors were providing leases and third party owner options, very much a leader through the last decade in the loan market. And many would say that, Well, the problem right now in the solar industry is that interest rates are up and loans are upside down. They no longer make sense. We have to revert back to TPO, and we have to revert back to leasing. Are we in a cycle as an industry that is perpetually whipsawed by the capital markets and things like interest rates, or do we have other alternatives to look for?

John Berger  7:14  
Well, at Sonova, we're really the only one that was offering all different types of financing, products, loan, lease, PPA, and we still do, I would say that, yes, interest rates hit loans twice as hard given the capital structure than they do leases. That is true. But the bigger change is the investment tax credit adders that are only available on the leases and PPAs and so do I think that loans are going to go to a very, very low percentage? Well, they already have for us, and the answer is almost certainly. So just the structure is negative against the loans, and when you got interest rate movement on top of that, you've got a double whammy that it's gonna be very difficult to change that trajectory. Does that really matter for the industry? I would argue that it does and it doesn't. I think it gives less choice in terms of financial product, that's true, and less choice is never better from the consumer standpoint. However, the other side of that. It does mandate service, and that was a real problem with the loans. And we're starting to, we're starting to face a lot of that as an industry. So I do think that we'll, we're ending up in the right spot, even though it's less choice. And I think we'll be, you know, more than fine. I think we'll be, I think we'll be okay with moving towards the lease. And PBA,

Nico Johnson  8:44  
you mentioned that we've been waiting for two years for domestic content. It's, you know, it's interesting for for folks like us that have been in the industry for more than a decade, who also have seen when we started in the industry, domestic content was a thing at the time, and nobody valued it. Now, we have have brought it back. I have kind of a two part question around domestic content. One is, what's your take? And I feel like the second is kind of tied to it, which is, are we heading towards a market where domestic content is essential, effectively in order for the economics to work, based on how the IRA is structured?

John Berger  9:21  
Yes, I think, I think it's been very difficult to be competitive without having domestic content qualified in your lease or PPA and so basically into your cell to the customer. And that's because it's very difficult to say, I'm going to sell the customer a 30% tax credit versus a 40% tax credit, and I'm going to leave out the energy communities, LMI credit and so forth, just to be concise with this. But I think it's in the way that it was set up on Thursday. There is a. High likelihood that almost 100% of our origination come q4 is going to be domestic content qualified. You could the manufacturers been on the phone emails with them just in the last 24 hours. They're all if they weren't already there, which many of them were there, they're putting the plans in the place that they had had on the shelf ready for this announcement that came on Thursday, and they're putting in place with speed, because it's a lot of money. So I think this, it's a different question, whether this was a good policy move or not, but, but it's here, it's definitely gonna have a huge impact, and it's definitely gonna move the market with regards to the equipment suppliers, the OEMs, and then what equipment that we're going to be able to essentially purchase within our leases and PPAs. So I've

Nico Johnson  10:49  
been asking this question since the rumble two, three, almost four years ago now, that was we're going to bring our industry back home, not whether it would happen. It seemed inevitable that it would, but how durable it actually is. What's your take on that?

John Berger  11:07  
Well, I think it's a part of a very clearly, it's a it's a broader trend now, for whatever reason. And my head of government affairs and and I lament on this often, is, why is it solar is always picked on in the first part with with China. I mean, look at Yellen comments last night. You know, for instance, it's like, Could you please put us outside and comment on something else, washing machines? Yeah, washing machines or something, something completely different. Let's, let's argue about autos or whatever it is, Windows. But, you know, it definitely has been the case and and, you know, I think that it goes to the broader geopolitical tensions in the world and the issues it is interesting. There was a comment made that I was reading. I think it was the Financial Times this morning or something. How fast the comment was made about how fast the US has gone from a free trade policy to a very closed door tariff, trade war, nationalistic policy. And that's true. And again, it's not specific to this industry we've just been at for whatever reason, at the point of it, or one of the points that aluminum steels is another one that's always there with us. Course we use aluminum, so that's a we're even a part of that. But in terms of commenting whether this is good or not, it seems like both sides of the aisle. It's one of the few things, if not the only thing, they can agree on. I still think freer and open trade is good, but it would also meant that if you're really worried about getting into war with China over Taiwan or war, war is not a capitalistic endeavor by definition. So I think that this is it, is what it is, is what I would say, and is it going to stay with us for a while, regardless who wins in November? Yes, I think that's been proven out over the last few years. And so it's good to see this industry come here, and then maybe we can get out of the limelight of the politics in this respect, and start talking about how we open a having consumers have more choice and and really get with the rest of the Western world as far as how we structure our electric industry so that we can make the full benefits of what we do for solar, storage and so forth, available to consumers at ever lower prices.

Nico Johnson  13:21  
One of the things that you and I have talked about at length is not only what's happening in the capital markets, but what does it mean? How does it translate down to the business level, the liquidity available for companies to do business, and oftentimes what that amounts to is the amount of working capital day to day, to buy equipment, to pay teams to move business forward. Can you talk a bit about where you see this, the aspect of working capital as it plays into the current down market that we that we find ourselves in, and also, you know, what does, what sort of advantage does having working capital give to a company like Sonova?

John Berger  13:57  
Yeah. So working capital is always the lifeblood of an industry, of a company, regardless of the industry in the company. So, you know, the way think about it is cash on hand, or access to cash on hand. And so no question about it. I think everybody would agree, because there's no question about it, but the liquidity in our industry is definitely materially less than it was two years ago. Call it at least certainly three years ago. And that's as simple as a commercial bank not giving a working capital loan to an install or a contractor to us having the more restrictions and costlier what they call debt warehouses. So, you know, it's not as free flowing and not we have a lot more rules, and the money costs a lot more. I see comments. I actually saw a comment this morning from a fellow Harvard graduate, which I was like, wow, what did you learn in school? Well, it was like, yeah, the lease companies and the financing companies are ripping people's faces off. They're charging all these interest rates for this. And I was like, Well, wait a minute, that that's something you need to go talk to the Federal Reserve about, not, not us. We didn't, we didn't raise the rates as much as that. And not saying that the Fed shouldn't have done that, I'm just saying that we're kind of along for the ride, to say the least, just like every other part of the economy. And what that, what, what that's leading to is, is that the Fed is trying to drain liquidity out of the system so they can, they can limit, then drop inflation. And so this is something that we should have expected. We certainly expected it. I think it's gone on far longer than I would have expected. I can tell you that my personal opinion, Are we near the end of this and the, you know, everybody's running, you know, trying to been predicting for the last year or so, when the Fed is going to cut rates and when liquidity can come back into the economy. I don't know. We're probably closer to that time period than away from it, but it's definitely harder by and the Fed is trying to make it harder to grow businesses and to do more economic activity in an attempt to fight inflation. So it's kind of a side effect of the medicine, if you will, is impacting our industry. Why our industry more than others? Because we're very capital tents of industry. That's why you

Nico Johnson  16:19  
touch on every aspect of the industry as one of the top brands and and let's say, one of the top movers in the industry, of the largest installers, financiers of solar. So you have purview over visibility into kind of the health, the relative health, of the various verticals or sectors, from dealers to distributors to equipment manufacturers. Could you give us a pulse on where you see health or signs of distress, in particular, downstream from snow, perhaps upstream from snow? Yeah,

John Berger  16:54  
you know, I would say that I think the the equipment side of things is going through a lot of turmoil right now. There's a lot more competition that's been the case. Will everybody make it? Of course not. That's just happens, naturally. No, I'm not going to name any names. That's not polite, but it certainly is. Continues to be a war, and in terms of moving your product, whatever your product is, a module, an inverter, an ESS unit, whatever it may be, and I don't think that that ends anytime soon. And of course, there's some that are a little more reliable, the technology is a little better, and so forth. And you can talk to those respective CEOs, and they'll certainly talk about their advantages, right? And that's that part of the industry, and it's going through its own stresses with the tariffs. And okay, now I got to move manufacturing to the United States. We just talked about that. Where am I going to get the money to do that? You know, those are the kind of things that we're seeing. Then the other place is on the contractor side, and there's a lot of concern about this. We lost a few dealers that you know, didn't make it, and that's been normal for the company's life, I would add. But, but you know, and I have to say, a little bit more than normal was in the q4 time frame, which is exactly what I warned everybody is like, that's the time that's going to happen, because that's the seasonal low period for sales, and therefore talk about working capital. That is when most contractors are pinched for money more than any other time of the year. By the way, this time of the year is the exact opposite, and we're seeing a lot more health so it doesn't mean that somebody's not in trouble and so forth, but it does mean that we're seeing, what I would say, a progressive increase in health in the contractor part of our industry. I think our part of the industry is interesting in that we're seeing more competitors come in, which is interesting given the equity prices that, you know, I'll just talk to my stock. Obviously, it's, you know, it's not good, sucks, whatever you want to call it, but in but the other, you know, we've had some other issues with competitors and so forth in that area where you deal in the financing side of things, I do think that we're headed towards a better path of cash generation. I think that once we have, like for instance, the domestic content out, and we can get our arms around over the next few days, and we can actually collect on those monies from the tax equity investors and so forth, I think that's going to help. It couldn't help but help the this part of the value chain, and it is the small it is, the smaller in number part of the value chain, the service providers. But I think is a key to making the liquidity flow through the entire industry, obviously, just given that that's where the money comes from. So I think we're headed in a right direction. I really do. I appreciate the utilities continue to raise rates at pretty rapid clips above the rate of inflation. And I'm confident they'll continue to do that. They agreed with our spreadsheets very well. Yeah, it does and so. And I think that the equipment gets better and better, more efficient, that long term trend continues and and more cost effective.

Nico Johnson  20:15  
I think you and Megan Nutting, head of policy, rightly pointed out quite some time ago that California was headed in a direction that wasn't particularly favorable or or partner oriented to the solar industry. I think we're seeing that, as many have called it an attack on the solar industry, we're seeing that, you know, bear fruit or strip the fruit, as the case may be, do you feel that this is indicative of what we should expect in other markets? Or what might you or how are you thinking? You know, you sit in Texas, where it's deregulated market and has a completely different approach to to solar than California. A lot of folks, I feel like ask the question, right? Chicken Little skies falling, California is going in a different direction than everybody expected. Except we expected it. What's gonna happen the rest of the nation now that California has made their play?

John Berger  21:12  
Yeah, that's a that's a great question. I think, I think where we're headed towards is we need, we're headed towards a revolution and and what I mean by that is, and I've said that for years, the technology is is increasingly going to deliver cleaner, less expensive, more reliable power to consumers and The current regulatory structure, yes, I mean, the utilities is is standing in the way, and we shouldn't be surprised by that. And that goes into California situation who doesn't want a monopoly to print money? I mean, I'd love it, right? So when somebody's trying to take that away from you, you're going to fight tooth and nail to keep it, and you may even do some things that you probably shouldn't be do. And that's exactly what we're seeing in California. Could we see that in other areas? Yes, we could. But eventually what ends up happening is the consumers rise up, and they're also these consumers are called voters, and they get what they want, which is cheaper, more reliable, cleaner power with and they want to be able to choose. So I've long said this, if Sonova doesn't do a good job for you, you should be able to fire Sonova and go hire somebody else. My job is to make sure that you don't feel that way and that you feel great about service, right? That's not a utility. That's not the US electric industry. It's if you don't like it tough, you don't like this price. Well, I paid a lot of lobbying dollars to get that, so I don't really care what you would think. And so we need to see that change. And what's really odd, and not a lot of Americans understand this is we're behind the times as a country. So if you go to Japan, you go to Australia, you go to Europe, you go to UK. Heck, even the French are more capitalistic, open to consumer choice than we are, which, as a Texan, really hurts me to say that. But that's true. That's a fact. And indeed, in Texas, it's really a tale of four cities, right? Because Houston, Dallas is really open, and San Antonio and Austin is not. And so even within Texas, we have a divided house, so to speak. This has to change. You we're going to imagine AT and T or I was talking to you about this. Imagine the path not taken AT and T was allowed to stay as a monopoly. We know for a fact that they hated the cell phone and tried to kill it. What would have happened to the cell cell phone? We don't know. We'll never know, is I understand that, and that's the point. But can we all agree that it probably wouldn't have gone as fast and as well as it did because of the breakup of at&t, and we need to have that here. And eventually, I think we're It's inevitable. We're going to get it, and we're going to look like the rest of the Western world, plus plus Japan. And that's going to be the benefit of our indeed, part of the industry, obviously, and more important to benefit to the consumer? Well,

Nico Johnson  24:21  
we've mentioned a couple of times from Texas. Texas is as many of the states in the South including North Carolina, where I'm from, predominantly red state, we're heading into an election year, so I think it's appropriate you touched on in the outset that we talk about what happens from your perch as the CEO of a publicly traded company that has a lot at stake if there is some sort of shake up in the legislation, what do you foresee if we have a change in administration in next January?

John Berger  24:53  
Yeah, I think you know, it's interesting that capital markets both in the US. Us in Europe and spend more a lot of time with visiting investors and lenders in Europe as well. You know, are positioned for a Trump victory. I think that's pretty clear, and that's that's that that is most likely one of the reasons why the equity prices in both Europe and the United States are so depressed in our industry. With that said, of course, that doesn't mean that you know those, those folks know what the outcome is going to be. What's interesting, though, is when you get you start talking to them, they're like, Well, yeah, I know, even if Trump wins, the likelihood the IRAs rolled back is very low. But it's, it's definitely a wet blanket on the current and the current environment. So I think that unless there's a clean sweep and a convincing one by the Republicans, which I, I frankly, don't see, I think we're too much. I think this election may look and be closer. Listening to the so called polling experts, if you can use those two words and a descriptor or somebody, but is that this could look more like 2016 than 2020 in terms of how close it's going to be in the number of states, there's only really three states that are supposedly going to call the election, and that is, I think it's Pennsylvania, Michigan. And I want to, want to say there's one other, well, actually Arizona, they say it's a swing state, but there's, it's basically the Midwest as essentially, I think it's Minnesota or something, but it's, we'll see what, we'll see what ends up happening there, but it's going to be a close election. But I election. But I think at the end of the day, you know what the IRA is going to look like is Obamacare, which is the Republicans scream and yell and hate, hate on it, but at the end of the day, when they're asked to vote against it, they're like, Well, I'm not doing that. It's too popular for my constituents, so I think that we largely be fine either way. Now, you know, somebody's got to pay for all this money that we're spending regardless who wins in November, and so that's that would be a concern, is, how do we we have something crazy like $5 trillion of $7 trillion of tax cuts coming due next expiring next year, and Congress, regardless of who wins the election, is going to have to deal with that. Deal with that. Where is that money going to come from? And so that's some more of the fears. But we're not going to get there. Aren't going to get five, $7 trillion out of our industry. We all know that. So they're going to have to do a lot of other things too. So I think overall, I think we're going to be in great shape. I think the the IRA is an energy policy, finally, from the United States, whether you love it or hate it, obviously, I think it's a big step in the right direction, and I think we're going to be largely intact no matter who wins in November. I firmly believe that

Nico Johnson  27:52  
John, as we wrap here, if you could leave every person that you meet with one thing, a thought, an inspiration, an idea, a call to action. What would it

John Berger  28:02  
be? I used the word revolution earlier. I'm gonna leave that revolution. But I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave with I'm gonna, I'm gonna have an audible here with you. Win. We're gonna win. We're gonna

Nico Johnson  28:15  
win, we're gonna win. Thank you, John Berger, and thank you all for taking the time to come and spend your post lunch with us. You.
