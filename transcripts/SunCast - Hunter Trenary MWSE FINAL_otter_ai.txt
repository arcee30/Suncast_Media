Speaker 1  5:00  
Also, when we first came out here, the rates for electricity for residential was about like seven cents per kilowatt hour,

Nico Johnson  5:06  
yeah, making it virtually impossible, exactly.

Speaker 1  5:08  
And so at that point, it was kind of disconcerting at the beginning, however, the assumptions that we made about the market have been completely correct. The rates went up by about 70% last year on

Nico Johnson  5:18  
year in one year. Yeah. What are they sitting at right now? For resi,

Speaker 1  5:21  
um, right now depends on the time of the year. But for Rezi, anywhere from about 15 to 17 and a half since more

Nico Johnson  5:27  
than doubled. Since you've been here in five years, the rates have more than doubled. Mm, hmm, wow. That's incredible. Back in 2006 when I started my first solar company, we used a pro forma that said to the customers, look, if we just take the assumption that your utility bill goes up at 5% a year, the way it always has. Then here's how the math works. This is gonna pay for itself in seven to eight years. And what we now know, by the way, that was 2006 almost 20 years ago, it's gone about 700% not 5% a year. So in 20 years, that would have been about 100% No, it's about five to 700% just in the last year alone. California rates, as as with here are up 30% 40% it's incredible. They just make it easier and easier for us to sell solar, don't

Speaker 1  6:12  
they? Nope, absolutely. And that's, that's what we told people to is like, Hey, if you can you if you can look and observe what's already happened in different states that have already passed this legislation, the trend is going to continue the exact same. So

Nico Johnson  6:23  
another thing that stands out to me is you and your co founder, it's kind of moving to Peoria. We're 220 year old, 22 year old guys trying to make it work. Your young entrepreneurs. How did you go about establishing a brand presence and then deciding the level of growth, the speed at which you grow in a market where you virtually have no competitors. How did you so talk about those two part, those two points, the brand presence and the growth,

Speaker 1  6:48  
yeah. So, I mean, I'll start with the growth, but that then it was actually very difficult. I'd say it's substantially easier to sell solar in Peoria now than it was five years ago. Yeah, because whenever we first got out there. There truly was not a single solar install in hardly any neighborhoods at all in Indian Peoria, yeah. And so back then, you know, I kind of always make the joke, but it truly was like teaching, like cavemen That fire was real. And so at that point, the growth was really as much as we put into it. Back then, it was just myself and my business partner, William Grant, but it was, it was very slow at first. Our first few installs didn't took nine months to get to install, yeah? Because Peoria, like, there's problems with, like, licenses reciprocating from Chicago and things of that nature. But what I feel like, having seen a lot of other solar companies come and go, I'd say there's two big reasons why companies fail and they either grow too slow or too quick. Yeah. And so for us, our growth plan has just always been, for us, what really, what comes natural, yeah. But to, to follow that up on the second question, as far as our our brand, yeah, I mean our name, even as sun collectors, yeah, right, it's just like we want it to be different, because, you know, you get a bunch of blank solar, blank energy, right? And yeah, I mean just even from the branding to begin with, is we just, we just want to be different. And you know that, ultimately, that's how we teach all of our sales guys to be as well, is just be different than everyone else you know, treat your customer right self through education, not high pressure sales techniques.

Nico Johnson  8:14  
Oh, fantastic. And I know that you've got about 20 sales guys and have, at some point in, in the in the growth expanded to about 50 employees. At what point did you make the choice to start bringing installation in house? Um,

Speaker 1  8:30  
I mean, yeah, and honestly, for that, it's been honestly out of necessity. Um, because when we first started out, we were just a sales organization, and we are, you know, part up with an EPC, you know, we'd sell it under their contract. But even with that, the project management level that we wanted was never there, as far as communication with our clients, speedy timelines, things of that nature, and even just the way they do the install, you know, like we've vetted and talked to hundreds of companies, and everyone wants to say that, you know, oh yeah. You know, we'll run the condo internally if we can. Yeah. But then you have some, you know, readily, large electrician that's on the site, and he doesn't want to get up and climb through an attic, so he's like, No, it's impossible. We can't do it. And it's like, with that, with that specific EPC, we were out there on the job site, and, like, crawled up into the attic. I was like, No, here, here's pictures. You can do it this way. Do it this way. Yeah. And it got to the point with that, with the owner of that EPC, where he said, Hey, you guys are not allowed to come out to your job sites anymore. Oh, wow, yeah, we're like, no shot, dude, not gonna happen, yeah? And so it went from that, so we did that relationship. We trained a local company, like, kind of that didn't understand the EPC relationship. So we taught them what that was and how to kind of bring in dealers, if you will. And then that was a pleasant change of pace, and they were a lot better, but there were still a lot of things they were lacking. And so after that, the next natural transition is to take contracts in house and then subcontract out the work. Yeah. So we had two subcontractors that we were primarily using. Yeah. And one of them we we almost like shut down that company just because of how much projects we sent them right overwhelmed them exactly. And at first they were a very solid company. However, once they had that many projects, we started seeing the customer care go to the wayside, sure they didn't have the back house go to the wayside Exactly. And so then we started working with a different sub, they couldn't keep up with the sales that we had either. And so really, out of necessity, we had to go purchase an electrical contracting company and just take everything in house, because

Nico Johnson  10:30  
you bought a company. Yes. Did you have to raise capital for that?

Speaker 1  10:33  
No, wow. No, no. We've been, uh, self funded since the beginning. Amazing. Yep. But, um, the other thing to that as well is, throughout all of the different relationships that we've had, whenever, like there is a problem, most contractors just point the finger at somebody else. We're always the people that accept responsibility for someone else's problems, because at the beginning of it or at the end of the day, it was us that came to that client, it was us that picked that subcontractor, it was us that picked that EPC. So it is our responsibility and our fault to make sure that the customer's expectations are met. And so I can't tell you how much money we've, you know, given back to clients over the years, where we're just paying for someone else's mistakes. Yeah, and so by bringing it in house, now, if something messed up, it's truly my fault, and I could put systems in place to prevent that mistake happening again,

Nico Johnson  11:19  
and you're happy to cover it, and I'm happy for it. So one of the things that stands out is you said, if it plays in Peoria, you have stayed in Peoria. Of course, you've probably, I assume you've expanded beyond Peoria at this point, but what you've created is a market in Peoria. You've got solar installs in every neighborhood, and as I mentioned from the stage here in MBA. Solar notably last fall, Sunrun opened an office in Peoria. Begs the question with the big competitors now, taking note, you've opened a market, they come in to compete with you. How do you really compete on value rather than pricing? It stands the reason that you would be tempted to try and match or so drop your price to compete with them. That's not how you approach the game. Yeah.

Speaker 1  12:07  
Well, I mean, first off, those, those companies, I mean, most of there's three big players in Peoria now, but all of them are pushing leases, even given the, you know, interest rates and the climate of the industry right now as a whole, we, since the beginning, we've always done things the hard way, which, you know, we'll do that till the end, but, um, but ultimately, I mean, we don't really have to compete with those companies too much. However, we did first get started out here. There was a lot of more so Midwest companies that were just very bottom of the barrel pricing. Yeah. And the company that I used to work for, ion solar, I'll shout them out, phenomenal company, nothing but good things to say about them. And a lot of what we do has been modeled off of them. Yeah, as far as, like, doing a premium install. And so there's certain things. I mean, it's not just using black panels, and I mean, it's like, truly using all black components I can't stand whenever I see solar, black solar panels on a roof, and then they have, like, the, you know, the silver like the silver rail or silver flashings, or just running conduit all over the entire roof. I mean, everything that we do, like every component, is full black. We put a wind guard on the front of the array to where you can't see up underneath all of our wire management is top notch, like, you can't see any wires hanging down whatsoever. But I mean, also on top of that, I mean it's just like, how can you for me, personally, how I've always been in sales is it's not, how can I drop to be the bottom of the barrel, is, how can I provide more value and justify the

Nico Johnson  13:26  
price? Yeah, who taught you that? Um,

Speaker 1  13:30  
I'd say, I'd say a combination of a few different mentors. But I mean, I on solar, ultimately, that was kind of their model back in the day on is like, No, hey, you know, we're not the cheapest company, but we're the best value that you're going to get, x, y, z. Here are the reasons why. Yeah, and, you know, people, some people go to Walmart and shop the best value. Some people like, for me, personally, whenever I'm going, if I ever go to Walmart, I'm trying to go like, you know, more middle, middle, middle to upper value. Sure. And it just kind of depends on the person, the buyer. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  13:55  
one of the things I've noticed is that you've got a really strong focus on community and making sure that the community knows, not only be present or you're investing in the community. Tell me more about

Speaker 1  14:03  
that. Yeah, no. Great question. So what we realized about three years ago is that we had been here for three years, and not everyone in the community knew who we were. And so, yeah. So about two years ago, I guess, we went on a big push to really give back to a community that has given so much to us. Yeah. And so in total, I want to say that we gave about $600,000 that year, wow, you know, from different organizations, whether that be yellow bear Foundation, casa, we're huge advocates of Casa. Yeah, support their cause quite a bit. You know, sponsoring the museum. And there's a lot more that I can go into on that as well. Well, you've also got

Nico Johnson  14:36  
some clever things that you do to just seed goodwill in the community as well, like the what's the tipping? Yeah, so

Speaker 1  14:43  
we've started two different things. One's a tipping big for the community event that we do where we pick a local, privately owned restaurant, not ones that are really expensive, more so ones that could probably use a little bit of help. And, yeah, once a month we get a group of people together. We have like 200 people in the group now, but typically about 20 to 30, maybe 40. Show up, and we all bring 100 bucks and server, and it's crazy seeing the impact, because it's almost like, you know, there's a higher force that's like, putting us in contact with that person, you know, as far as just having, like, you know, a single mom whose car just broke down, couldn't afford the maintenance for it, four kids at home wasn't gonna be able to get to work to make money for the family, and stuff like those. Those stories happen time and time again. My favorite of the two things we started though is it's called merry and bright. Christmas. Merry and Bright. Yep. So we started that about five years ago, and that was back whenever we didn't have $1 to give. But I had sat down with this one family, and they, you know, they had hearts of gold. Unfortunately, their roof was like falling in. They didn't have money to go solar or credit, but, but what they did, though, is they took in and fostered the like LGBTQ community, which finding homes for those people, or can be difficult, yeah. And so we saw that, and basically we took them out and said, Hey, kids, Christmas is on us. Go fill the shopping cart. Wow. And so they were all stoked. And then come five years later. So we give the opportunity of our team every Christmas like, Hey, if you want to sponsor a family, you know, here's the cost. If you do it, the company will match you, yeah. And so we did about 18 families last year, and in total, we've probably done about like 50 or so maybe since we began. How

Nico Johnson  16:11  
do you ensure that you've got a healthy pipeline of folks that want to work for you?

Speaker 1  16:15  
I mean, a lot of it's just around, not retention. But I say at our core Sun collectors is not just a solar company. Whenever we're talking about the sales and the installers, I'd say at our core Sun collectors is a personal development company. And so it's not about having, you know, because with solar sales, there's good money in it, but it's not just about buying the flashy car. It's about how can you use that money and make that money really matter and make a difference in the world. And so, you know, a lot of we teach our guys is, you know, helping them, you know, build credit, have financial literacy, you know, help them buy their first property. Help them buy their second and third investment properties. Yeah, and really, just, like, really mentoring and just like, for me, personally, I we joke around about this in the sales office, but I could personally probably go out and just do solar sales myself solo, and make a lot more money than what I make currently, yeah, but I was given an opportunity at a company, and it's completely changed the trajectory of my life, so I feel that it's my responsibility to give that same opportunity to people in our community.

Nico Johnson  17:16  
Yeah, who's Tammy Dugger,

Speaker 1  17:20  
yeah. So, so again, talking about paying for other companies, mistakes and whatnot again. So we're not perfect. It's construction. We make mistakes all the time, you know, but it's, it's not about the mistake that gets made. It's more so how does the company handle so said mistakes, right? So this was pretty early on. This is probably about four years or so ago, and basically what happened is the lesson that we learned is in smaller jurisdictions, sometimes you could get away with a verbal permit. The city would say, hey, go out. You're fine to build. So we went out there and we installed this ground array at this Well, first we did a Ground Array at her at her personal house. She owns a veterinary clinic. We had a Ground Array there. Soon as we finished the install, the city came out and said, hey, you know what? Actually, we just passed an ordinance we're not gonna allow solar in the village of Tremont. This was also during covid, and so we had just finished it. Payments on the system, on the loan had started up because we had done the install and yeah, long story short is it took six months where we went to, I went to three different variance meetings, they're all over zoom. And in the meantime, over that six months, she's getting power bill and full payment. And so ultimately, they made an example out of her, and they ruled that they're not gonna allow the Ground Array. So we literally had to take the Ground Array up, move it to the vet clinic they have most east west facing with, like, a small little area for South facing, it would have done about 85% of her power instead of 100 so what we ended up doing is we gave her, like an additional, like, 15 panels to get her up to 100% no cost. And then we also covered her electric bill for six months, which that was, like a $400 average power bill because it was during covid. And if you think we made $1 on that project, you're completely mistaken. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  18:57  
No, just on the 2400 alone that you paid for electric bills to go. That's your profit, right there,

Speaker 1  19:01  
yeah? So with all that being said, Yeah, we definitely saw a lot of red on that project. But on the flip side of that, she's huge in the community, right? And the people I love when mistakes do happen, because then that gives us the opportunity to show how we take care of things. And the people that there are mistakes on their project, those people leave the best reviews, yeah, and they also send the most amount of referrals as well. The one benefit that I love about Peoria is Word travels fast, and if you help, if you if you screw one person over, pardon my French, but they're going to tell the whole world that solar's a scam. Doesn't work, whereas, if you just do good business and just treat people the way you want to be treated, yeah, they're going to go, you know, tell a few friends and so like, you know that's ultimately why we get the amount of referrals that we do, is because we just stand behind our word and just take care of our people.

Nico Johnson  19:47  
You mentioned that a lot of the income, or the competitors, larger companies that are coming in are pushing lease products, and I remember in a conversation that we had that you don't do five. Products that have dealer fees. How do you approach helping your customers afford and pay for these products?

Speaker 1  20:06  
Yeah, so we, and again, kind of circling back, we, we always like to do things the hard way. And so like, yeah, you could get set up with, you know, like the big solar financiers that you know, you can do loan documents on the spot. Get the whole deal wrapped up, have a nice bow on it historically, you know, we've always worked with credit unions because and it, you know, certain community based way to do it, yep, and not necessarily, like we have one that's semi local and another one out of Washington. But, you know, it adds extra steps to the process. And, you know, maybe we lose a few deals during the underwriting process and stuff. You know, it is what it is. But at the end of the day, they got a solid interest rate and no dealer fee attached to it whatsoever. And the market that we're in, it makes zero sense to go and tack on a 30% dealer fee. You're already getting 60% plus of the 60 subsidized Why would you front load the interest into that? And so our pricing often came out a lot less than a lot of our competitors, even due to that alone. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  20:57  
and you are packaging loan products, and despite the higher interest rates, because you are paying it forward by removing the dealer fee out of the equation

Speaker 1  21:05  
exactly. And it just, it comes down to education, which most companies don't educate their sales reps entirely at all, really. But I mean, it depends. So Peoria, there's a very high income and a very low cost of living, which means that there's a fair amount of disposable income to be used. And so, I mean, it just depends on the client, right? Like, there's some markets where do, if it does make sense, yeah, you know, if someone doesn't have the means to pay it off and they are going to take it to term, then, yeah, it could make sense. But where we're at it just, it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever for

Nico Johnson  21:33  
us. You know that it was a high disposable income disparity in that market ahead of time?

Speaker 1  21:39  
No, okay, I wish, I wish I had done more research. Because rewind a little bit. When we first came out to Peoria, it was about a year or two after Caterpillar had just pulled all their executives out of Peoria and moved them all to Chicago, no way. And when we first got there, you see nothing but mansions that are just sitting taken that cannot be resold, because no one has the income to purchase them, right? So whenever we first moved out there, I mean, that was disconcerting, for sure, but, but ultimately, yeah, just the whole, the whole like attitude towards Peoria, it was very negative because, but ultimately, it was the best thing that could happen to the area, because there was too much dependence on that big corporation. And so there's been a lot of good that's came. And now, right now, pure is on the rise, like it's really popping and and it's nice to see the attitude and people like starting to have that pride in purity again. Yeah,

Nico Johnson  22:29  
well, it seems like there's a lot of folks that pride in sun collectors as well. I know since you mentioned that a lot of the work that you do is in that development space. For You know, it is personal development mindset. I imagine that you, like me are an acolyte of of Zig Ziglar. May he rest in peace. Any favorite quotes from Zig as we wrap up? Yeah,

Speaker 1  22:51  
and I'm probably gonna butcher it and not say it verbatim, but ultimately, it's just like, you know, if you if you help enough other people get what they want, then naturally you're gonna get what you want. Yeah, right. And so that's why we'd like, you know, putting our sales reps in a position to where they can create generational wealth and set themselves up and, yeah, teach them how to really, ultimately, just make a big impact on the planet, and more so, how to leave the planet a better way than how we found it.

Nico Johnson  23:16  
Yeah, well, I think that you're well on your way there. It's really a pleasure to get a chance to hang out learn more about how you guys are building the business. Thank you, Hunter for taking the time to speak with us. Absolutely. Thank

Unknown Speaker  23:28  
you. You.
