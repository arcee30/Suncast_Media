Speaker 1  0:00  
inflation is eating your paycheck up, it costs a lot to gas up your car, I walked out a grocery store with five bags of groceries. So I could hold the one hand, it was $127. That's what people are focused on. I mean, I know that they know that if you're going to come up with big lofty ideals about changing the world and saving the polar bears, people don't care. They don't care. They want to know, if this project is in my community, what's it going to do for my community? I'm not saying they don't care about the rest of the country, or they don't care about carbon, or they don't care about polar bears or anything else. But that's the immediate question they have. What's it gonna do for me? And we answer that question.

Nico Johnson  0:39  
A lot of folks want to say that energy is in this dichotomy and us versus them a fossil or oil and gas, world versus renewables world. And as I've said before, there is no versus there is only us, we have to figure out this energy transition together. One of the things that I'm delighted to know is that there are politicians who also agree with that, and I've had the pleasure of meeting, one of North Carolina's staunchest not just advocates for clean energy, but converts to clean energy on the host, Nico Johnson. And today, I get the joy and pleasure of sitting down with John Socha. John was a North Carolina State Representative for 10 years five terms. And today we're going to talk about his conversion story and how it lives on as a legacy in the work that he continues to do. John, it's so great to have you on SunCast.

Unknown Speaker  1:35  
Well, thanks for having me here. I appreciate it.

Nico Johnson  1:36  
So you were telling me a fun story about your your when you first came into the legislature here in North Carolina, you as many Republicans were essentially against renewables thought that it was a sham. I'd love to hear how you how you came to a different realization.

Speaker 1  1:59  
That is an interesting store. When I was first elected. Well, my history was a retired military officer. I own several small businesses, so I wasn't really in the energy sector. So when I came to the legislature, I was concerned about tax reform, things like that. Lobbyists came to my office, the conservative lobbyists and said, What do you think about solar? And Joe said, The only thing I know about solar energy is it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for government tax subsidies. Otherwise, it's a bunch of right, Joan, it's not gonna work. But then she said, Well, the organization I represent has a little bit different viewpoint. And I said, Oh, what's that? And she proceeded to tell me what it was. And I was polite, and I listened. And there was something that she says, kind of made sense. Yeah. So what I knew about her was she worked for an association. I also knew that she was a conservative. So I assumed she wasn't trying to hoodwink me on anything. So I listened. Gave me a piece of paper. Read it. She said, if you have any questions, call me. So I thought about it that night, I called her next day asked for some more information. When on my own little personal journey of discovery of energy, yeah, for about five or six months. And I changed my mind, because what she was telling me was, I mean, if this is absolute truth up and down, she, everybody shades things, a little bit of what other folks were telling me and other sectors of the energy sector where they weren't even close, right. So there was a trusted conservative given me a message about clean energy, which I then pursued. So I went from skeptic to champion in about six or eight months. Wow.

Nico Johnson  3:36  
And you did a lot of research, you said on your own. I'm curious where you sought information, where did you end up finding the kinds of information that that gave you a foundational understanding of clean energy such that you were converted? Yeah. And

Speaker 1  3:50  
that's a great question. And I thought to myself, self, self, where am I going to look for this? I did a Google search and found all kinds of information. I almost had trash but information on the internet. Yeah. And then I ended up on some of the federal websites. Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm not saying the federal government does everything right. But generally speaking, they I liked the way they presented the information because it was factual. Yeah, I could read it ahead. Footnotes. I looked at the footnotes went to the primary sources. I mean, there was is this through to there's numbers, mostly through department of surgery. Yeah. I'm a numbers guy and an army guy, an army guy. Give me facts. Don't give me your feelings. Yeah, I'll have my own feelings. I want the facts. So I found the facts. And the deeper and deeper I dug into it is like, wow, yeah, but one of the things, you know, one of my incoming supposition is solar wouldn't exist without massive sub subsidies. So I thought, Well, what else has been subsidized in the energy field right. Now, what I found was, as I'm sure many people listening to this video now is that there's lots of subsidies The difference between what was 10 years ago, subsidies were out in the open, right vise things that have been there for decades and are buried in the tax included, right? When you start looking into tax code and start doing numbers, you'll see massive amounts of subsidies for oil and gas and things like that. And don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, right. But if you're gonna compare one thing to another, you know, let's compare the same thing. It's like when I watch Sesame Street with my kids, when these things is not like another kitty, Puppy, a baby goat and an Apple Watch. Let's compare likes to lie. Yeah, not skew information. So it makes one side look better than the other.

Nico Johnson  5:46  
I mentioned that you did serve for 10 years in the legislature. First of all, thank you for the staunch advocacy for clean energy that you gave the state of North Carolina and in so doing the southeast in general, during that tenure, having liberated yourself from the, from the chains of legislature, and what you can do and say, to focus your energy and attention, you have now in the private sector focused on helping the conservative rural communities learn to embrace the knowledge that over a decade you cultivated and and you are now the president of a company or an organization called the conservative energy network. Can you tell us a bit more about the premise of the C E. N. And were at a high level you engage at a state level with with policymakers now that you're on the other side of the

Speaker 1  6:36  
the? Well, first, the 10 years, I believe in true citizen legislatures and I think that career politicians on either side, they need to go home and get in touch with what's really happening, right. So about 2016, somebody who was thinking just like me and the state of Michigan, came to the conclusion that clean energy was a conservative issue. And it was a good thing. They started the conservative energy network back then in the state of Michigan, and it grew to six to eight. And then when I can, when I was selected as the CEO last year, where it's 24 states that we operate in, wow, we operate basically at two levels. We talk to our federal components, you know, senators, but we don't do a lot of that. Our main focus is at the state level, where we go in and we're a 501 C three. So it's about education. We try and educate legislators in all the states we work in, to give them a similar experience to mine, I

Nico Johnson  7:38  
say full circle, like now you're coming in as the evangelist. evangelist is right. But I think in fact, I mean, think about it evangelists, in many ways, show up with a pamphlet that presents the facts about their ideology, and hope that it's in some way swayed them to consider alternative means of thinking,

Speaker 1  7:59  
I guess, but I don't stand on the side of the road, or the airport handing out things. That's good. They're knocking down. So we we educate legislators on things. We don't lobby for any bill. But every bill that's out there has underlying principles that people need to know about. Because quite frankly, being a legislator is very difficult. Yeah, you, you get elected. You can't know everything about everything. So you have to rely on somebody like me, I relied on a trusted conservative. That's what we want legislators to do with us. Right. And it doesn't mean we don't talk to people who self identify as liberal. We certainly do. But that's our main focus. Yeah. And then the next focus is down at the county and low level level. Yeah.

Nico Johnson  8:45  
Tell me about the land and liberty coalition.

Speaker 1  8:48  
That is the land and liberty coalition is a project of conservative energy network. And most renewable projects, both solar and wind, onshore wind are in rural areas, which, irrespective of their party registration, those people are conservative farmers, ranchers, small towns of 1000 to 3000 people. Sure. So I don't care how the registered the vote, they have conservative values. Yeah. And all of a sudden, somebody's coming in with one of these things they don't understand. Yeah. And they don't understand it, not because they're not smart and a very smart people in rollers. Absolutely. But it's something new that's there. They lack information, lack of information. So again, as the trusted agent, we go into areas where there's going to be solar and onshore wind, and we educate county commissioners, we educate municipal leaders, we educate chambers of commerce, people who show up at open meeting about what is solar and onshore wind do. Everybody pretty much knows how it works. But what's the benefit if this project goes here? What's the bin The fit that accrues to you, right as a member of this community. That's what's left out a lot of time. Yeah. And we just talk, like we're talking now. Although when I show up at something like that I don't wear a suit and a tie, more like this, or the vest or whatever, like I'm going on.

Nico Johnson  10:15  
Yeah. Well, we talked about it last night that all too often, folks will try to do this kind of advocacy. And a they show up as liberals with their liberal ideologies and their and even their liberal dress, if you will, their garment. But why is it that they're apart from the obvious that you've you've just scrapped you've discussed? Why have you found that? Si Si, en coming into these town hall? meetings or environments is so compelling, are so much more compelling? As

Speaker 1  10:48  
I always say, have to live in the real world? Yeah. And what's going on in the real world today? Inflation is in your paycheck up? Yeah, it costs a lot to gas up your car. I walked out a grocery store with five bags of groceries. So I could hold the one hand, it was $127. That's what people are focused on, right? I mean, I know that they know that. Yeah. If you're going to come up with big lofty ideals about changing the world and saving the polar bears, and people don't care. Yeah, they don't care. They want to know, if this project is in my community, what's it going to do for my community? I'm not saying they don't care about the rest of the country, or they don't care about carbon, or they don't care about polar bears or anything else. But that's the immediate question they have. Yeah. What's it gonna do for me? And we answer that question,

Nico Johnson  11:35  
right? And are you finding that developers in these rural communities or developers that are working in these rural communities are aware of organizations like CNN, how are you engaged in how do you know that there's a need for a town hall meeting where see and can make a difference?

Speaker 1  11:50  
Well, first of all, a lot of developers understand exactly what I'm saying. Yeah. And they do what I'm saying, but they go in with the name of their company on their shirt or behind them. Sure, which sometimes works. Sometimes it doesn't work hard. They do have a hostile crowd. Yeah. Because they assume you're only coming in here to do whatever you're going to do to make a lot of money.

Nico Johnson  12:14  
And you say whatever it takes. Yeah. And you're gonna say whatever it takes to get us convinced. So

Speaker 1  12:18  
we could have the same message. I mean, a developer could have the message. We could have the message, but just like, and my conversion, if you will, it's not the message. It's the messenger. Very

Nico Johnson  12:31  
cool. And I guess the the second question to that is, how do developers know that they can bring in a CDN? Or how are folks finding you?

Speaker 1  12:42  
Week in the states in which we operate? We're in 25. States, we we go to them? The developer community, it's not like it's millions of developers. It's a relatively small community. So they know of our successes, right? in different places. And oftentimes they call us. Yeah, I mean, right now and land and liberty, we have 30 gigawatts of solar and wind that we're working on educating population in that now. 30 gigawatts? That's a lot. A lot.

Nico Johnson  13:13  
That's a lot. Yeah. John, one of the things that I have told you, I'm impressed with the conversations that we always have there around this seeming oxymoron of conservatives and clean energy, because if you watch the media, you would assume from Fox and Breitbart that every conservative hates the idea of the energy transition or clean energy and they call solar. They say that solar winds like you know, create cancer and kill whales. But you're clear evidence that that is not true across the conservative landscape. 10 echoes in Georgia is clear evidence that that is not true. What what are you what conversations are you having in private about the reality of conservatives and clean energy?

Speaker 1  13:54  
Well, well, what do conservatives in rural areas care about? What do I care about as a conservative when it comes to energy in whole sector? Yeah, what I care about is cost for the ratepayers, which is everybody who pays an electric bill? Yeah, if you can keep the cost low. Two thumbs up. Yeah, that's a good thing. What else do I care about? I care about property rights. If a farmer or rancher wants a clean energy facility on his property, why is it up to his neighbor to decide that if he can have it right, it's not know if he wanted a better view? Or if he wanted a view of where the putting in the facility he can go buy the land? Right. But sometimes people get confused in rural America as to where their property rights end and where the next guy property rights begin. So that's a big thing. We don't talk much about carbon reduction out roller Yeah, because it's it's one of those thoughts and sometimes people have a hard time getting their head around, it's it's a little easier to get your head around it now with the extreme weather events we've had. But still combining those two isn't really a talking point. It's property rights. And its cost the cost of energy. And we need to get the cost of all forms of energy, whether it's the power your vehicle, to warm and cold, your home, whatever we need to keep it as low as we can.

Nico Johnson  15:22  
Well, it's encouraging to me that there are organizations out there like conservative energy network, that are advocating in our rural communities for the truth about the their property rights and our ability with clean energy to reduce the cost to serve our communities, with electricity moving forward, the ability to amplify what our grid can afford to do now with a multiplicity of generation technologies. And it's champions like you, Johnson, who are out there, helping to carry helping to carry that load. So thank you for the work that you're doing. And thank you for that. Yeah. And thank you for tuning in to another session of SunCast Media Zone. We're live at the UNC Clean Tech Summit. Join us again for the next session.
